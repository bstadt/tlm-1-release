This process removes or deactivates \" a so-called decapacitating factor that binds to sperm as they pass through the male reproductive tract. \" 8 This permits the acrosome reaction to occur, which is the means by which Iytic enzymes in the sperm \" are released so that they can facilitate the passage of the sperm through the egg coverings. \" 9 Then the sperm are able to penetrate the egg so fertilization can begin.   Fertilization usually occurs in the end of the Fallopian [MASK_NOLOSS] hours to reach the egg, and if not \" fertilized within 24 hours after ovulation, it dies. \" 10 Fertilization, however, is not just a simple penetration of the surface of the egg. Rather, it is a complex biochemical process in which a sperm gradually penetrates various layers of the egg. Only after this single sperm has fully penetrated the egg and the haploid female nucleus, one having only one chromosome pair, has developed, do the cytoplasm of the egg and the nuclear contents of the sperm finally merge to give the new entity its diploid set of chromosomes. This process is called syngamy. It takes about 24 hours to complete and the resulting entity is called the zygote. Thus the process of fertilization ( and it is important to note that it is a process ) generally takes between 12-24 hours to complete, 11 with another 24-hour period required for the two haploid nuclei to fuse.   Fertilization accomplishes four major events : giving the entity the complete set of 46 chromosomes ; [MASK_NOLOSS] ; and the initiation of cleavage, the cell division of the entity.   Now begins a very complex set of cell divisions as the fertilized egg begins its journey down the Fallopian tube to the uterus. About 30 hours after fertilization, there is a two-cell division ; around 40-50 hours there is a division into four cells ; and after about 60 hours the eight-stage cell division is reached. \" When the embryo approaches the entrance to the uterus, it is in the 12-16 cell stage, the morula.

This occurs on the fourth day. \" 12 Although the cells become compacted here, there is yet no predetermination of any one cell to become a specific entity or part of an entity. On around the sixth or seventh day the organism, now called the blastocyst, reaches the uterine wall and begins the process of its implantation there so that it can continue to develop. Here we have a differentiation into two types of cells : the trophectoderm, which becomes the outer wall of the blastocyst, [MASK_NOLOSS] of the embryo proper. This process of implantation is completed by the end of the second week, at which time there is \" primitive uteroplacental circulation. \" 13   Critical to note is that from the blastocyst state to the completion of implantation the pre-embryo is capable of dividing into multiple entities. 14 In a few documented cases these entities have, after division, recombined into one entity again. Nor must this particular zygote become a human ; it can become a hydatidiform mole, a product of an abnormal fertili%ation which is formed of placental tissue.   Note also that the zygote does not possess sufficient genetic information within its chromosomes to develop into an embryo that will be the precursor of an individual member of the human species. At this stage the zygote is neither self-contained nor self-sufficient for such further clevelopment, as was earlier believed. To become a human embryo, further essential and supplementary genetic information to what can be found in the zygote itself is required, namely   the genetic material from maternal mitochondria, [MASK_NOLOSS] of messenger RNA or proteins. In terms of molecular hiolog, it is incorrect to say that the zygote has all the informing molecules for embryo development ; rather, at most, the zygote possesses the molecules that have the potential to acquire informing capacity. 15   That potential informing capacity is given in time through interaction with other molecules.... This new molecule with its informing capacity was not coded in the genome. Thus, the determination to be or to have particular characteristics is given in time through the information',\n",
       " \"[YEAR:1991]Section : Natures Infinate Book Physiological adaptations that helped American blacks survive slavery may now be predisposing their descendants to hypertension   On the walls of the main corridor at UCLA Medical School hang thirty seven photographs that tell a moving story. They are the portraits of each graduating class, from the year that the school opened ( Class of 1955 ) to the latest crop ( Class of 1991 ). Throughout the 1950s and early 1960s the portraits are overwhelmingly of young white men, diluted by only a few white women and Asian men. The first black student graduated in 1961, an event not repeated for several more years. When I came to UCLA in 1966, I found myself lecturing to seventy-six students, of whom seventy-four were white. Thereafter the numbers of blacks, Hispanics, and Asians exploded, until the most recent photos show the number of white medical students declining toward a minority.   In these changes of racial composition, there is of course nothing unique about UCLA Medical School. While the shifts in its student body mirror those taking place, [MASK_NOLOSS] society, we still have a long way to go before professional groups truly mirror society itself. But ethnic diversity among physicians is especially important because of the dangers inherent in a profession composed of white practitioners for whom white biology is the norm.   Different ethnic groups face different health problems, for reasons of genes as well as of life style. Familiar examples include the prevalence of skin cancer and cystic fibrosis in whites, stomach cancer and stroke in Japanese, and diabetes in Hispanics and Pacific islanders. Each year, when I teach a seminar course in ethnically varying disease patterns, these by-now-familiar textbook facts assume a gripping reality, as my various students choose to discuss some disease that affects themselves or their relatives. To read about the molecular biology of sickle-cell anemia is one thing. It's quite another thing when one of my students, a black man homozygous for the sickle-cell gene, describes the pain of his own sickling attacks and how they have affected his life.   Sickle-cell anemia is a case [MASK_NOLOSS] among peoples are well understood.

       " '[YEAR:1991] one of my students, a black man homozygous for the sickle-cell gene, describes the pain of his own sickling attacks and how they have affected his life.   Sickle-cell anemia is a case [MASK_NOLOSS] among peoples are well understood. ( It evolved only in malarial regions because it confers resistance against malaria. ) But in many other cases the evolutionary origins are not nearly so transparent. Why is it, for example, that only some human populations have a high frequency of the Tay-Sachs gene or of diabetes? In several of my columns I\\'ve discussed this evolutionary problem in connection with smallpox and hereditary tyrosinemia, as well as malaria ( June 1988, February 1989, February 1990 ). This column will ask why hypertension ( high blood pressure ) should be the leading killer of American blacks.   Compared with American whites of the same age and sex, American blacks have, on the average, higher blood pressure, double the risk of developing hypertension, and nearly ten times the risk of dying of it. By age fifty, nearly half of U. S. black men are hypertensive. For a given age and blood pressure, hypertension more often causes heart disease and especially kidney failure and strokes in [MASK_NOLOSS] kidney disease in U. S. blacks is eighteen times that in whites, blacks account for about two-thirds of U. S. patients with hypertensive kidney failure, even though they make up only about one-tenth of the population. Around the world, only Japanese exceed U. S. blacks in their risk of dying from stroke. Yet it was not until 1932 that the average difference in blood pressure between U. S. blacks and whites was clearly demonstrated, thereby exposing a major health problem outside the norms of white medicine.   What is it about American blacks that makes them disproportionately likely to develop hypertension and then to die of its consequences? While this question is of course especially \" interesting \" to black readers, it also concerns all Americans, because other ethnic groups in the United States are not so far behind blacks in their risk of hypertension. If Natural History readers are a cross section of the United States, then about one-quarter of you now have high blood pressure, and more than half of you will die of a [MASK_NOLOSS]. Thus, we all have valid reasons for being interested in hypertension.   First, some background on what those numbers mean when your doctor inflates a rubber cuff about your arm, listens, deflates the cuff, and finally pronounces,',\n",
       " '[YEAR:1991] seem to be the whole explanation : hypertensive blacks aren\\'t merely like severely hypertensive whites. Instead, physiological differences seem to contribute as well. On consuming salt, blacks retain it on average far longer before excreting it into the urine, and they experience a greater rise in blood pressure on a high-salt diet. Hypertension is more likely to be \" salt-sensitive \" in blacks than in whites, meaning that blood pressure is more likely to rise and fall with rises and falls in dietary salt intake. By the same token, black hypertension is more likely to be treated successfully by drugs that cause the kidneys to excrete salt ( the so-called thiazide diuretics ) and less likely to respond to those drugs that reduce heart rate and cardiac output ( so-called beta blockers, such as propanolol ). These facts suggest that there are some qualitative differences between the causes of black and white hypertension, with [MASK_NOLOSS] salt.   Physicians often refer to this postulated feature as a \" defect \" : for example, \" kidneys of blacks have a genetic defect in excreting sodium. \" As an evolutionary biologist, though, I hear warning bells going off inside me whenever a seemingly harmful trait that occurs frequently in an old and large human population is dismissed as a \" defect. \" Given enough generations, genes that greatly impede survival are extremely unlikely to spread, unless their net effect is to increase survival and reproductive success. Human medicine has furnished the best examples of seemingly defective genes being propelled to high frequency by counterbalancing benefits. For example, sickle-cell hemoglobin protects far more people against malaria than it kills of anemia, while the Tay-Sachs gene may have protected far more Jews against tuberculosis than it killed of neurological disease. Thus, to understand why U. S. blacks now are prone to die as a result of their kidneys\\'retaining salt, we need to ask under what conditions people might have benefited from kidneys good [MASK_NOLOSS] understand from the perspective of modern Western society, where saltshakers are on every dining table, salt ( sodium chloride ) is cheap, and our bodies\\'main problem is getting rid of it. But imagine what the world used to be like before saltshakers became ubiquitous. Most plants contain very little sodium, yet animals require sodium at high concentrations in all their extracellular fluids. As a result, carnivores readily obtain their needed sodium by eating herbivores, but herbivores themselves face big problems in acquiring that sodium. That\\'s why the animals',\n",
       " '[YEAR:1991] and plantation life emphasized diarrhea, or \" fluxes \" in eighteenth-century terminology, as one of the leading killers of slaves.   Grim and Wilson reason, then, that slavery suddenly selected for superefficient kidneys surpassing the efficient kidneys already selected by thousands of years of West African history. Only those slaves who were best able to retain salt could survive the periodic risk of high salt loss to which they were exposed. Salt supersavers would have had the further advantage of building up, under normal conditions, more of a salt reserve in their body fluids and bones, thereby enabling them to survive longer or more frequent bouts of diarrhea. Those superkidneys became a disadvantage only when modern medicine began to reduce diarrhea\\'s lethal impact, thereby transforming a blessing into a curse.   Thus, we have two possible evolutionary explanations [MASK_NOLOSS] slow selection by conditions operating in Africa for millennia ; the other, rapid recent selection by slave conditions within the past few centuries. The result in either case would make New World blacks more susceptible than whites to hypertension, but the second explanation would, in addition, make them more susceptible than African blacks. At present, we don\\'t know the relative importance of these two explanations. Grim and Wilson\\'s provocative hypothesis is likely to stimulate medical and physiological comparisons of American blacks with African blacks and thereby to help resolve the question.   While this piece has focused on one medical problem in one human population, it has several larger morals. One, of course, is that our differing genetic heritages predispose us to different diseases, depending on the part of the world where our ancestors lived. Another is that our genetic differences reflect not only ancient conditions in different parts of the world but also recent episodes of migration and mortality. A well-established example is the decrease in frequency of the sickle-cell hemoglobin [MASK_NOLOSS] because selection for resistance to malaria is now unimportant in the United States. The example of black hypertension that Grim and Wilson discuss opens the door to considering other possible selective effects of the slave experience. They note that occasional periods of starvation might have selected slaves for superefficient sugar metabolism, leading under modem conditions to a propensity for diabetes.   Finally, consider a still more universal moral. Almost all people alive today exist under very different conditions from those under which every human lived 10,000 years ago. It\\'s remarkable that our old genetic heritage now permits us to survive at all under such different circumstances. But our heritage still catches up with most of us, who will die of life style',\n",

Methionine adenosyltransferase exists in several forms in man.

Deficiency of the hepatic Beta isoenzyme causes biochemical findings very similar to those in our patient C.

In the three patients described here, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain before treatment showed increased signal intensity from the central white matter. The two older patients ( B and C ) showed low signal in the subcortical U-fibres [MASK_NOLOSS] which suggests that the changes observed are a result of\",\n",

The histopathological abnormalities thus seem to represent the spectrum of a limited set of responses that the posterior retina/choroid can mount during an immunodestructive event. ( n11 )   Immunopathological studies have been directed at identifying the cell(s) responsible for the tissue damage. Granulomatous lesions contain abundant macrophages and, as might be expected for cross-sectional studies, variable numbers of CD4 and CD8 T cells. ( n12 ) In an \" early \" case of sympathetic ophthalmia CD4 T cells expressing high levels of interleukin-2 receptor ( IL-2r ) on the surface predominated, and dendritic cells were also detected. ( n13 ) How the [MASK_NOLOSS] discussed below.   Uveitis can be associated with systemic disease in which other ocular manifestations ( such as scleritis and the peripheral corneal ulceration of rheumatoid arthritis ) occur. The frequent association of these ocular changes with uveitis makes it likely that their pathogenesis and mechanisms of tissue damage are very similar to those of uveitis.   Mechanisms of autoimmune damage in uveitis   Like the mechanisms required to mount an immune response to a foreign antigen, autoimmune responses are initiated by the presentation of the autoantigen by interferon-producing MHC class II positive antigenpresenting cells to CD4 T cells, which then produce lymphokines such as IL-2 and activate other types of CD4 and CD8 T cells. These cells act as effector cells, either directly ( cytotoxic T cells ) or by activating other effector cells such as antibody-secreting B cells or antigen-specific activated macrophages.   The interaction between the antigen on the antigenpresenting cell and the CD4 T cell receptor is highly specific ( fig 2 ). Accessory molecules of adhesion-such as the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ), which [MASK_NOLOSS] ) -- are required to promote the reaction and induce a T-cell signalling event. Adhesion molecules such as ICAM-I are also important in the homing of the activated T cells to the site of autoimmune inflammation since they are expressed on activated endothelial cells and promote **27;174;TOOLONG interactions before migration of the cell into the tissues.

Direct information on the precise mechanisms of autoimmune damage in human uveitis is difficult to obtain since most of the material obtained for analysis represents advanced, end-stage disease. Much of our information on the nature of the cells responsible for tissue damage in uveitis comes from studies of experimental models. Endotoxininduced uveitis, which develops within hours of an intradermal injection of endotoxins such as Shigella endotoxin, serves as a useful model of acute anterior uveitis, in which the inflammation is predominantly non-lymphocytic and neutrophilic. Despite the severity of the inflammation, once it subsides there is remarkably little residual damage. As with the more systemic effects of endotoxin, the uveitis is probably due to the effects of cytokine cascades and inflammatory mediators [MASK_NOLOSS] the classic immune responses. The possibility that bacterial toxins act as superantigenss ( n14 ) in AAU has thus far not been investigated.   Some forms of uveitis, such as lens-induced uveitis and anterior uveitis associated with systemic disease, are considered to represent ( auto ) immune responses to tissue antigens, although the antigenic targets have not yet been clearly identified. Lens antigens and vitreous proteins, such as type IX collagen, ( n15 ) are candidate antigens in specific conditions such as phacoanaphylactic uveitis and pars planitis but the evidence is weak. Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease may be a response to melanocyte antigens but, as described below, the ( immuno ) pathology is similar to that of experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis ( EAU ), in which specific photoreceptor-related retinal antigens are implicated.

( n18 ) In the early phase, CD4 T cells accumulate around blood vessels in the retina and choroid, while phagocytic macrophages infiltrate the presumed site of ( auto ) immune attack, the photoreceptor cell. A wave of CD8 T cells follows, with increasing numbers of macrophages, and if a sufficiently high dose of antigen is used for \" immunisation \", a striking polymorphonuclear leucocyte infiltrate may be observed. During resolution of the lesion, B cells and plasma cells increase in the tissues ( n18 ) until finally a fibrous or, more rarely, a fibrovascular scar develops at the site.

Evidence for autoimmune tissue destruction in several diseases widely accepted to be autoimmune in origin ( eg, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, and Graves'thyroid disease ) is at best circumstantial, mainly because the antigens have not been identified. Their acceptance as autoimmune diseases is partly due to the existence of good experimental models closely resembling the human disease in which either the antigen is well defined ( eg, collagen-induced arthritis, thyroglobulin-induced thyroiditis, and myelin-basic-protein MBP-induced encephalomyelitis ) or the animal spontaneously acquires a disease in which autoimmune destructive events can be clearly demonstrated ( eg, the non-organ-specific **33;203;TOOLONG syndrome in the MRL/1pr mouse and insulin-dependent diabetes in the NOD mouse ( n23, n24 ) ).

Specificity in immune responses resides not so much in the peptide-MHC interaction ( any one MHC alloantigen can bind several different peptides ) but in the interaction between the peptide-MHC complex and the T-cell receptor. Accordingly, attention has focused on V ( variable region ) gene usage by the T-cell receptor autoimmune reactions. Usage seems to be restricted to the Vbeta8.2 gene in EAE and to the Vbeta6 and Vbeta5 genes in murine arthritis. ( n29 ) Restriction to Vbetagene usage has also been observed in models of EAU based on adoptive transfer of interphotoreceptor retinal binding protein and S-antigen-specific T-cell clones and by [MASK_NOLOSS] These findings have considerable implications for therapy of autoimmune uveitis with T-cell vaccines.   Many of the difficulties in understanding disease mechanisms in uveitis have been due to the apparent heterogeneity of clinical syndromes, each of which has been considered to be a different clinical entity. However, the development of good experimental models has helped to define these conditions and to provide a rational basis for immunological investigation. The hope is that better understanding of the disease process will lead to the development of specific therapeutic approaches.

Systemic steroids   Patients who do not respond to orbital floor injections of steroids and those with bilateral ocular involvement need systemic steroids in doses sufficient to suppress the inflammatory response. The doses vary with disease severity, and with age and weight for children under 12 years. Alternate-day therapy should be avoided at the start since such a schedule delays response and often patients notice worsening of vision on non-therapy days.   The rate of reduction of the steroid dose depends on the type and extent of the ocular disorder, the response, and the presence of other systemic disease processes. Efficacy of therapy is judged by improvement of the clinical signs, as well as by an increase of visual acuity when its impairment is due to vitritis, papillitis, and macular oedema. The dose is gradually reduced to the minimum required to keep the inflammatory process under [MASK_NOLOSS] disease is no longer active. Duration of treatment can vary from months to years. When there is disease in other organs, such as the lung in sarcoidosis, different steroid-reduction regimens may be required, since dose-adjustment is then not influenced by ocular improvement alone.   Other immunosuppressive drugs   Ocular inflammation can be controlled with steroids alone in many patients, the dose being reduced to an acceptable maintenance level ( usually less than 15 mg prednisone/day ). However, when the patient can not tolerate steroids or when control requires unacceptably high doses, other immunosuppressive agents should be added to the regimen. Cyclosporin is rapidly replacing azathioprine, chlorambucil, or cyclophosphamide as the supplementary agent of choice in patients of all ages, provided they have normal renal function.

At 5 mg/kg per day the side-effects are less severe but the drug becomes ineffective on its own in the initial management of posterior uveitis and has to be given with systemic steroids. Exactly how these drugs are used in combination varies from centre to centre, but a useful regimen is to put the patient on 40 mg/day prednisolone if the patient is already on steroids, or, for those [MASK_NOLOSS] least a week before the introduction of cyclosporin at a dose of 5 mg/kg per day in two divided doses. The steroid dose is then slowly reduced. In some patients it has been possible to withdraw steroids altogether when the disease is quiescent, leaving the patient controlled on a small dose of cyclosporin alone.   The cyclosporin dose is controlled mainly by monitoring of serum creatinine. Blood pressure should also be monitored because the likelihood of nephrotociaty is increased when there is hypertension.

Monitoring of blood concentrations of cyclosporin can sometimes be useful in helping to keep doses to the minimum necessary. ( n9 ) If cyclosporin enables the steroid dose to be lowered, then its introduction has been worth while. If not, other immunosuppressive drugs need to be tried.

( n15 ) It is a useful model in which new drugs can be assessed and new approaches to immunotherapy examined. Attempts have been made both to prevent disease occurring after immunisation and to decrease the intensity of the inflammatory process once it has begun.   Treatment with monoclonal antibodies against the CD4 molecule ( n16 ) class II MHC molecules ( Ia ) ( n17 ) or with retinal S-antigen ( n8 ) has been successful in preventing or delaying the development of uveitis in immunised rats. A suppressor T-cell line has reduced the intensity of EAU, ( n19 ) and vaccination with ocular-antigen-specific T-cells has protected against disease induction. ( n20 )   Activated T-cells express interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) receptors on their cell surface and a large proportion of T-cells infiltrating [MASK_NOLOSS] directed against activated T-cells has been tried in EAU, with a chimeric recombinant protein ( IL-2-PE40 ) composed of IL-2 fused to a modified Pseudomonas exotoxin lacking its cell-recognition domain.

Induction of tolerance to specific antigens in peripheral T cells was achieved in a mouse skin graft model with a combination of monoclonal antibodies to CD4 and CD8 molecules.

[MASK_NOLOSS] an identical sequence in the host genome. Homologous recombination occurs frequently in yeast and bacteria but is extremely rare in mammalian and human cells. Selection for homologous recombination events is a powerful new tool for studying gene function in vivo because it can be used for gene targeting, or placing transgenes at a precise location in the host genome. The integration of transgenes by homologous recombination alleviates secondary problems caused by endogenous gene disruption in transfected cells. This method of gene targeting is currently used by molecular biologists to inactivate mammalian genes via insertion of a defective gene or a foreign sequence into a gene under investigation. In the very near future, this technique will be perfected to allow mammalian gene transplacement by which an endogenous cellular gene is replaced with a different allele ( structural form ) of the same gene or with a genetically engineered derivative of the gene. Such gene transplacement is commonplace in yeast, where it is used to study gene function in the cell. Because unaided homologous recombination is such a rare event in mammalian [MASK_NOLOSS] of gene targeting is dependent upon the ability to identify, or select for, the rare cells in a population that have undergone homologous recombination events or to increase the number of cells of this type in the population. EVALUATION OF GENE FUNCTION IN TRANSGENIC MICE   Recent developments allow investigators to manipulate genes in mouse embryos and to introduce foreign genes into these embryos as well ( Gordon, 1989 ; Jaenisch, 1989 ; Rossant, 1990 ). Cloned genes can be microinjected into one-celled mouse embryos. Under the proper conditions, the injected transgenes integrate into the genome of the recipient embryos and are transferred to both germline tissues ( related to sexual reproduction ) and somatic tissues, which become differentiated into various tissues and organs of the body. An alternate approach for the production of transgenic embryos is to introduce the transgene into special cells of the early mouse embryo called embryonic stem ( ES ) cells ( Evans and Kaufman, 1981 ; Gossler et al., 1986 ; Thomas and Capecchi, 1987 ). The modified ES [MASK_NOLOSS] cells can be regarded as the equivalent of a unicellular mouse because they participate in the formation of all tissues of the developing transgenic mouse. The',\n",

( William Bateson, in fact, coined the term homeosis in 1894 to identify such changes in mammalian ribs and vertebrae. ) The literature on manipulation of Hox genes is just beginning to accumulate for vertebrates, but preliminary results affirm the cardinal rule that overexpression makes posterior structures move forward, while inactivation causes anterior features to move backward. In 1989, C. Wright, K. Cho, J. Hardwicke, R. Collins, and E. De Robertis reported results of inactivating a homeotic gene in the toad Xenopus by injecting antibodies to its transcribed protein into one-celled embryos ( Cell, vol. 59, pp. 81-93 ). The resultant tadpole developed with an extension of hindbrain structures into posterior regions usually occupied by vertebrae-the expected backward movement of an anterior structure following inactivation of a homeotic gene.

There is other evidence to suggest that concentrations of ozone in the troposphere ( the lowest atmospheric layer that extends from the surface to the beginning of the stratosphere and contains the remaining 10 percent of atmospheric ozone ) have been increasing by about 1 percent per year over the past 20 years. This means that the decreases in stratospheric ozone probably exceed those for the total column content, which is the sum of tropospheric and stratospheric ozone. What Is Destroying the Ozone?   The Ozone Trends Panel attributed the observed decreases in stratospheric ozone to increasing atmospheric levels of chlorofluorocarbons ( see figure 2 ). The chlorofluorocarbons, Freon-11 [MASK_NOLOSS] 2 ), are usually referred to as CFC-11 and CFC-12, respectively.   The major source of atmospheric CFC-11 and CFC-12 is the aerosol spray can, which uses these chemically inert gases as propellents. CFCs are also used as refrigerants in home and automobile air conditioners and in the manufacturing of closed-cell and open-cell foams.   Additional trace gases that destroy ozone in the stratosphere by chemical reactions include bromine ( Br ), nitric oxide ( NO ) and the hydroxyl radical ( OH ). Methane reactions produce the water vapor that releases the hydroxyl radical in the stratosphere. Ozone Depletion Caused by Chlorine and Bromine   The cause of the Antarctic ozone hole is now believed to be the chlorine and bromine originally released from the CFCs and halons, or brominated CFCs. These two elements are released into the atmosphere through a series of reactions.   Chlorine atoms are liberated in the stratosphere by the action of solar radiation on CFC-11 and CFC-12 molecules, the only significant source of chlorine atoms in the stratosphere. The ice [MASK_NOLOSS] Antarctic stratosphere greatly facilitate the chemical reactions that free chlorine atoms from the reservoir compounds, where they reside after being released from the CFCs. Then the chlorine is readily available to chemically destroy ozone in the Antarctic stratosphere after the long, cold Antarctic winter.   Atmospheric levels of CFC-11 and CFC-12 are about 0.3 ppbv and 0.5 ppbv, respectively. The levels of each of these gases is increasing at a rate of about 5 percent per year.

The largest color video FPDs in production today measure about 6 inches by 8 inches. At the Japan Electronics Show in October of this year, Sharp demonstrated a 17-inch diagonal, 1280 X 1024-pixel AMLCD with performance comparable to that of a 19-inch CRT workstation. Materials for generating light   Almost all electronic color displays create a colored image by the light additive process using red, green and blue as the primaries. Most displays -- including CRTs, LEDs and electroluminescent displays -- do this directly : Electron bandgap transitions emit visible photons that stimulate the viewer's retina.   Another important FPD technology, called plasma panels, uses ultraviolet-excited phosphors. In this type of display the subpixel electrodes ionize mercury atoms in a gas mixture. Ultraviolet light emitted by the mercury excites an appropriate phosphor in the immediate proximity of the subpixel. The uv emission is blocked from exciting the phosphors for other colors associated with neighboring subpixels. The viewer sees the light from the individual phosphor dots associated with [MASK_NOLOSS] the photons seen by the viewer come from a classical fluorescent backlight that is continuously projected uniformly over the back side of the display. ( See figure 5. ) The light results from mercury uv excitation of a mix of phosphors that have appropriate emission peaks in red, green and blue. Nature has been kind to display designers by making three appropriate phosphors readily available in fluorescent lamps. The AMLCD acts as a controllable array of subpixel apertures, and each subpixel has a red, green or blue filter to allow passage of the corresponding color when electrically opened.   One display not based on additive color is the triplecell liquid crystal projection display of Infocus Systems Inc, of Tualatin, Oregon. 6 At each pixel, light from a broadband white backlight passes through three liquid crystal cells in series.

Discussion [MASK_NOLOSS], blood transfusions are associated with a high risk of alloimmunisation and/or increase in haemolysis. In this study, all patients at some time developed detectable warm autoantibodies against red cells and required transfusion therapy for anaemia, and 23 patients developed alloantibodies secondary to blood transfusion. At first glance, these findings could easily be interpreted as presenting the so-called typical constellation of AIHA. However, a careful analysis of the history and the serological course of each individual clearly indicated that patients with classical AIHA seem to be less susceptible to alloimmunisation than has previously been thought. At first presentation, only 53 of the 79 patients had AIHA associated with detectable autoantibodies. Transfusions were well tolerated in these 53 patients, but even more surprising was that there was not one case of alloimmunisation. Although the increase in haemoglobin concentrations by red cell transfusions was usually inadequate, as expected, there was no increase in haemolysis. The reasons for this are not clear. Could it be related to the underlying disease itself, in as much as autologous [MASK_NOLOSS] at maximum rates? If so, the transfused red cells should survive at least as long as autologous cells. Another reason for the lack of a haemolytic transfusion reaction may be that after transfusion the concentration of antibody molecules per cell is reduced owing to the increased number of circulating red cells. Whether the immune response in these patients is generally downregulated by increased red-cell destruction, or whether the immune system has become depressed by the administration of corticosteroids and/or by red cell transfusion, ( n12 ) requires further studies.   The pathogenesis of autoimmunisation by blood transfusion in the other patients is obscure. The possibility that these patients were already autoimmunised before transfusion with undetectable autoantibodies at first investigation ( the so called Coombs-negative AIHA ) is unlikely, since the patients did not show signs of haemolytic anaemia before transfusion therapy. This viewpoint is further supported by the fact that the development of autoantibodies after transfusion is not uncommon in patients with delayed haemolytic transfusion reactions. ( n10, n13 ) Likewise, the clinical course of patients who were [MASK_NOLOSS] haemolytic transfusion reaction rather than for classical AIHA. But the reasons why the resultant autoantibodies in patients with CLL or lymphoma persisted whereas those in the other patients did not, remain unresolved.

Maintenance chemotherapy and prevention of relapse   What evidence is there to show that maintenance chemotherapy with 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate prevents relapses after modern intensive treatment, and how likely are the low doses typically used for maintenance chemotherapy to eradicate the residual leukaemia cells not killed by substantially [MASK_NOLOSS] to be answered, especially since the strategy of continuous low-dose treatment for long periods is in striking contrast to modern trends in cancer chemotherapy, where high doses of alternating drugs are used to reduce the risk of drug resistance. ( n9 ) And why should maintenance chemotherapy be effective in ALL but not in acute myelogenous leukaemia, Iymphomas, or other cancers?   There are no randomised trials to evaluate the efficacy of maintenance chemotherapy with 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate in children with ALL who receive modern intensive chemotherapy. Nevertheless, indirect data suggest that this strategy does help to prevent relapse. Most trials that compare different schedules or doses of maintenance chemotherapy show fewer relapses in subjects who receive continuous rather than intermittent therapy and high rather than low doses. ( n10-n14 ) 14 Similarly, maintenance treatment for less than 2-3 years is associated with more relapses ( n12, n13, n15 ) and, when the pharrnacokinetics of 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate are correlated with relapse rates, children who absorb or metabolise these drugs differently have remissions of different durations.

Although we still do not fully understand how cure is achieved, some recent data provide important insights. Analysis of Ig-cell and T-cell receptor gene rearrangements in blood and bone-marrow cells from children with ALL in remission indicate that cells related to the leukaemia clone persist after the completion of intensive chemotherapy. ( n20 ) After 1-3 years of maintenance chemotherapy these cells are no longer detectable and are perhaps eradicated.   There are several models of how maintenance chemotherapy with 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate might prevent relapse. Most popular is the notion that these drugs kill the relatively few leukaemia cells that survive intensive chemotherapy : because these cells divide slowly, it is suggested that continuous, long-term drug exposure is needed to kill them. [MASK_NOLOSS] and methotrexate fit this model, but other data indicate that drug-mediated killing of leukaemia cells is unlikely. For example, these drugs are frequently given at low doses that only modestly suppress normal haematopoiesis ; it seems unlikely that leukaemia cells which survive intensive multidrug chemotherapy would be killed by such low doses, especially as there are no convincing data that leukaemia cells are more sensitive to these drugs than normal haematopoietic cells. Even regimens that give higher doses of 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate are unlikely to kill leukaemia stem cells without causing bone-marrow aplasia. one might also anticipate that drug resistance would occur when methotrexate is given continuously. ( n21 )   A second model is that maintenance chemotherapy stimulates the immune system to control or to kill residual leukaemia cells. ( n22 ) Three observations are against this suggestion.

( n28 )   Pre-B cell suicide?   We propose a third model of how maintenance chemotherapy might work in ALL, based on the notion that most bone-marrow precursor B cells -- the cells usually transformed in ALL -- die spontaneously. Mature B cells in lymphoid tissue ( eg, lymph-nodes and spleen ) appear to be in a dynamic state. Most die after a short programmed lifespan of a few days. Dying B cells are continuously replaced by precursor B cells in the bone marrow. These precursor B cells comprise pro-B cells ( pre-pre-B cells ), pre-B cells, and immature B cells. Pro-B cells ( early, intermediate, and late ) are characterised by expression of terminal **27;1357;TOOLONG ( TdT ) and/or B-cellspecific antigens. Rearrangement of Mu heavy-chain immunoglobulin genes, an important early step in precursor B-cell development, occurs in late pro-B cells [MASK_NOLOSS] programmed cell death, probably by apoptosis, whereas B cells with functional 11-chain rearrangement survive and proliferate.   When a functional Mu-chain rearrangement in a pro-B cell leads to cytoplasmic 11-chain expression, it is termed a large pre-B cell. This cell, after division, develops into a post-mitotic small pre-B cell, which then undergoes rearrangement of Kappaor Lambdalight-chain genes. Again, cells with non-functional rearrangements die whereas those with functional rearrangements survive. Small pre-B cells that express surface IgM are termed immature B cells, and migrate from the bone marrow to peripheral lymphoid tissues where they mature further and acquire other surface molecules ( eg, IgD ). Most of these B cells die',\n",

Most of these B cells die after several weeks or months.   Production of B cells in the bone marrow is inefficient, and only about 10-25% of precursor B cells survive. Factors that affect B-cell survival include the functional Mu-Chain and light-chain immunoglobulin gene rearrangement and the likelihood of positive and negative cell selection of autoreactive or otherwise desirable or undesirable clones. Mu-chain rearrangement is considerably more complex [MASK_NOLOSS] at that stage ; interestingly, most cases of B-cell ALL occur in precursor B cells at this stage of development.   Hypothesis   We suggest that maintenance chemotherapy for ALL is effective not because it eliminates all remaining leukaemia cells, but because it controls their growth sufficiently to allow the operation of normal mechanisms to eliminate precursor B cells. If this model of maintenance chemotherapy is correct, one would expect that the likelihood of cure of precursor-B-cell ALL should correlate with the probability of successful immunoglobulin or T-cell-receptor gene rearrangement in leukaemia cells. Preliminary data indeed indicate that cure rates in pro-Bcell ALL exceed those in pre-B-cell ALL, which are in turn greater than those in ALL of mature B cells. One would also expect maintenance chemotherapy to be ineffective in ALL of mature B cells in which immunoglobulin genes are already functionally rearranged and where cell selection has already occurred : results of treatment for Burkitt's leukaemia/lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, B-cell lymphomas, and multiple myeloma support this view.

( n35 )   The period of greatest bone-marrow B-cell production roughly coincides with the maximum risk of onset of ALL in children. Furthermore, some of the processes involved in B-cell development, such as immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene rearrangement and random insertion of nucleotide residues in DNA by terminal **27;1386;TOOLONG, are error or mutation prone. Could the onset of ALL in children be intimately, perhaps unavoidably, linked to the processes involved in normal B-cell development (? ( n36 ) Similarly, although we have mainly discussed precursor-Bcell ALL, the same or similar mechanisms may operate in T-cell ALL, where there is also evidence of a high rate of death of precursor T cells ; only about 10% of precursor T cells survive.   We do not yet know [MASK_NOLOSS] effective in patients with ALL. Our theory of how it might work, if it does work -- by controlling the numbers of residual leukaemia cells so that they can be eradicated by normal mechanisms -- might be relevant to other cancers in which cell death is preprogrammed into the normal counterparts of the transformed cells.

Storage for at most 72 h at room temperature on a continuous motion shaker was allowed ( about 220/972 transfusions ). The criteria for a platelet transfusion on the same day were based on the morning platelet count plus findings on careful clinical examination of the patient. 1 h posttransfusion platelet counts of less than 10 x 10 9 /l ( 35/972 transfusions 3.7% ) were not routinely taken as an indication for further platelet transfusion on the same day ( except for 13 instances in which such transfusions were given ).

Platelets were counted manually at a magnification of 400 x in an improved Neubauer haematocytometer ( 5 x 16 fields ) after all had been allowed to sediment for [MASK_NOLOSS] values below 50 x 10 9 /l the manual count was always applied.

After exclusion of these procedure-related bleeding complications we noted a progressive increase in the frequency of haemorrhage with declining platelet counts ( figure ). Minor forms of haemorrhage occurred much more frequency than did the more serious forms at all platelet count bands. Overall, 28 major non-lethal bleeding episodes were observed. A case of subdural haematoma complicated by cerebral oedema and jacksonian epilepsy contributing to death is discussed below ( patient 1 ). Epistaxis requiring tamponade and red-cell support occurred 4 times. 3 episodes of haemoptysis, 7 of gastrointestinal haemorrhage, and 3 of macrohaeamaturia were observed. 6 of these 13 patients needed red-cell transfusions ( 2-5units, mean 3 2 units ).

We wondered whether the lack of success with pertussis immunoglobulins might be attributable to inadequate dose, so we designed a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of two immunoglobulin preparations.   The study was conducted at three Swedish hospitals. We enrolled 73 children aged less than 36 months who were admitted with a clinical diagnosis of whooping cough. On admission they were assigned to one of three groups : ( a ) monocomponent pertussis toxoid vaccine ; ( b ) two-component acellular vaccine also containing filamentous haemagglutinin ; or ( c ) 20% albumin solution ( placebo ). The immunoglobulins had a high antitoxin content and had been raised with acellular pertussis vaccines. Diagnosis of pertussis was confirmed by laboratory tests and the follow-up was completed in 67 children. The main study group consisted of 47 children with </= 14 days of disease before therapy. Duration of whoops post-treatment was 8.7 days ( 95% CI 4.8,12.6 ) in [MASK_NOLOSS] 11.9, 293 ) in the 14 receiving placebo ( p = 0.0041 ). Mean number of whoops during the first week of follow-up was also significantly reduced ( p = 0.0196 ). We found that early treatment was important, since the effect on duration of whoops was most pronounced when disease duration before treatment was </= 7 days. There were no significant differences between the two immunoglobulin preparations.

       " '[YEAR:1992].   Introduction   In infants and young children whooping cough ( pertussis ) can be a serious disease. Antibiotics and bronchodilators are often given although their effect is thought to be limited. Specific immunoglobulin to pertussis, raised by immunisation of donors with whole-cell pertussis vaccine, is available in some countries but its value has been questioned. Hyperimmune serum was widely prescribed and regarded as beneficial in the 1930s and 1940s ; ( n1, n2 ) later studies showed little or no effect [MASK_NOLOSS] ( n5 ) came to the same conclusion.   Advances in pertussis research have provided a rationale for immunoglobulin therapy. Thus, by analogy with diphtheria and tetanus, for which immunoglobulin treatment is effective if given early, pertussis is believed to be a toxin-induced disease. ( n6 ) In addition, human gamma globulin and monoclonal antibodies have prophylactic and therapeutic effects in mice infected with Bordetella pertussis. ( n7 )   We wondered whether the lack of effect reported with pertussis immunoglobulins could be due to inadequate dose -- the early claims of a beneficial effect came from studies with much larger volumes of convalescent serum or immunoglobulin than those used subsequently. Moreover, we found ( n8 ) that the antitoxin content of existing pertussis immunoglobulins does not exceed that of ordinary convalescent sera from adults. The amount of antitoxin administered to a child when these immunoglobulins are given in the recommended doses is therefore very small. Consequently, we designed a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial to assess the effect of two immunoglobulin preparations, raised to high antitoxin [MASK_NOLOSS] treatment of children who had been admitted to hospital with whooping cough. Materials and methods   Patients   Children under 3 years with a clinical diagnosis of whooping cough who had been admitted consecutively to hospital at either of the three study sites with a disease duration of not more than 14 days were candidates for enrolment if the parents consented. A final sample of 87 children -- ie, 29 in each group -- was needed to reject the null hypothesis that both immunoglobulin preparations are equivalent to the placebo with a significance level of 5% ( type I error 0.05 ) and with a power of 80% ( type II error 0.2 ). If one assumes a 10% placebo effect, a 50% reduction of any one of the three main disease features -- cough, vomiting, and whoops can be shown. A loss of 10',\n",
       " '[YEAR:1992] should be achieved by the immunoglobulin therapy. The corresponding 3 children with </= 14 days disease duration in the placebo group and with the sample drawn 4 days after treatment showed no measurable antitoxin concentration.   Separate analysis of the 20 children with pretreatment disease duration of more than 14 days showed no differences between the groups for any of the symptoms. Mean duration of whoops after therapy was similar for the 15 children in the treatment groups and the 5 in the placebo group. By comparison with children with a pretreatment disease duration of </= 14 days, and especially of </= 7 days, duration of whoops in this group with late immunoglobulin treatment was [MASK_NOLOSS] respectively ).   Side-effects of the treatment were reported by 4/73 ( 5% ) enrolled children, 1 from each immunoglobulin group ( transient localised rash in both ) and 2 from the placebo group ( 1 loose stools for 2 weeks post-treatment, 1 swelling and pain at the injection site for a day ). Discussion   Our results show that specific immunoglobulin is beneficial in the treatment of whooping cough, reducing the duration and the number of whoops. The only other placebo-controlled study, by Balagtas et al in 1971, ( n5 ) showed no beneficial effect of a pertussis immunoglobulin preparation. That trial was very similar to ours in design, sample size, and analysis of symptoms ; the main differences seem to be the dose and preparations of immunoglobulin. Thus the dose was 2.5 ml whereas we gave 8 ml, and the antitoxin content of the preparation used by Balagtas et al is unknown. Our earlier study ( n8 ) of commercially available pertussis immunoglobulins showed that only one had an antitoxin titre similar to that [MASK_NOLOSS]. The recommended doses for all the commercial immunoglobulins were so low that none of the treatments could have resulted in a measurable blood antitoxin concentration whereas our results show antitoxin titres of 8 and 16 in samples drawn after treatment but before the children mounted their own immune response.   The immunoglobulins we used had been raised with the new acellular pertussis vaccines. These vaccines induce high antitoxin titres in adults, without the risk of the serious side-effects that have been attributed to whole-cell vaccines. It is still unclear whether hyperimmunisation of adult donors can be achieved, but our limited experience indicates that repeated injections will not raise antibody titres above a certain level, specific for the individual donor.

It is still unclear whether hyperimmunisation of adult donors can be achieved, but our limited experience indicates that repeated injections will not raise antibody titres above a certain level, specific for the individual donor. Since laboratory methods for determining antibodies to pertussis toxin are readily available, the best way to obtain high-titre immunoglobulin preparations is to give one injection of vaccine to potential donors and then to screen for high-responders whose plasma can be used.   The treatment was well tolerated by all the children. Our worries that administration of a total of 8 [MASK_NOLOSS] for the patient, parents, or staff were unfounded. In most cases, the treatment was administered well within the range of 24 h indicated by the protocol.   The reduction in the number or duration of whoops is the first clinical observation to provide some support to the theory that whoops are a toxin-mediated effect. ( n6 ) This feature of the disease is also the only one that differentiates whooping cough from other conditions characterised by protracted coughing ( n11 ) and may, despite its benign nature, cause most alarm to patients and parents.   That therapy was most effective when administered early was to be expected on theoretical grounds and on the basis of previous experience with immunoglobulin treatment for diphtheria and tetanus. The rapid binding of pertussis toxin to cells is irreversible and early intervention with neutralising antibodies would therefore be the method of choice. ( n6 ) It follows that prophylactic administration of specific immunoglobulin should also be effective.   We encountered difficulties with clinical features that were not characteristic of the disease. Many children manifested [MASK_NOLOSS] which the parents were unable to distinguish from the coughing caused by whooping cough. Likewise, we had presumed that vomiting would follow a coughing attack and would therefore represent an indirect measure of this feature. At the end of the study, we found that during the follow-up period 10 children had had episodes of gastroenteritis, which was confirmed as rotavirus infection in 2 who had been admitted to hospital.   Thus we have shown a beneficial effect of early pertussis immunoglobulin therapy on the duration and the number of whoops. Use of',\n",

All patients were infected with hepatitis C virus and had abnormal liver function ( n20 ) ( unpublished ). Some changes with time were seen in seronegative patients, notably a decline in total plasma IgG and a rise in IgM. The introduction of heat-treated factor VIII from early 1985 may have had some bearing on these changes.

When the number of patients studied is small and when several ( possibly ) independent indices are measured, the risk of a chance deviation from a normal distribution for any one of these indices ( a type 2 statistical error ) is correspondingly greater. However, the validity of our findings is supported by two observations : first, the mean plasma IgM concentration was higher for symptomatic patients not only in the preinfection sample but continuously over the next four years ; and second, the specific IgM anti-HIV response in the early seroconversion phase is probably not independent of total plasma IgM. Our data suggest that underlying the variable rates of disease progression among patients infected with an identical virus are inherent differences in immune responsiveness. The HIV envelope glycoprotein includes several potent antigenic epitopes capable of eliciting a proliferative response from T cells even on primary exposure. ( n21 ) The higher concentrations of total [MASK_NOLOSS] subsequent rapid disease progression, probably reflect a general tendency to mount a prolonged and intense IgM response to many antigens -- precisely the pattern of specific antibody response to HIV that subsequently developed in these patients.

( n22, n23 ) Although the differences in immune responsiveness among the members of our cohort, for which total plasma IgM concentration serves as a crude indicator, were probably within the normal population range and, in most circumstances, would be clinically insignificant, we suggest that they made an important contribution to the course of HIV infection. The European Collaborative Study ( n24 ). of childen born to HIV-infected mothers also recorded a direct relation between total plasma immunoglobulin ( specifically a high IgM ) and subsequent rapid disease progression.   The underlying basis of immunological \" hyper-responsiveness \" is uncertain. Although it is tempting to invoke [MASK_NOLOSS] yet to be demonstrated convincingly in man. As an alternative, it may be argued that enhanced activity of specific cellular and humoral immune systems reflects a relative failure of non-specific immunity and that this defect accounts for the success of HIV as a pathogen. Whatever the precise mechanisms, much evidence has accumulated that the pathogenesis of HIV disease is related directly to the nature and degree of the host immune response. We have now shown that individuals at risk of rapid disease progression can be identified in the earliest stages of infection and even before exposure. Our findings lend further support to the proposition ( n3 ) that modulation of host immune function should be examined further in therapeutic trials among HIV-infected patients.

This requires very high performance preamplifiers(*) with high common-mode rejection and high input impedance for the signal detection near the site of the electrodes.   We desire a usable proportional control signal from the unprocessed EMG and therefore make some assumptions about the character of the \" raw \" EMG signal. We treat the EMG signal as an amplitude modulated \" carrier \" with multiplicative noise. Logically, the assumption of multiplicative noise is satisfying because as muscle-force level increases, so does the firing and the recruitment of [MASK_NOLOSS] \" stair-step \" control signal ( measured load-cell output or isometric muscle force ) and the corresponding processed EMG signal demonstrating the increase in \" noise \" with EMG signal amplitude increase. The raw EMG is processed much like AM radio demodulation. First, bandpass filtering removes unrelated signals and prevents aliasing if a digital filtering system is used. Second, rectification produces a non-zero-mean signal. Last, the signal is smoothed with a low-pass filter ( 4, 9 ). Figure 2 shows the general flow of the signal. The nature of the low-pass filter has been extensively researched, and many definitions of the optimal filter for myoelectric processing have been proposed ( 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 ).   Many researchers have designed filters based upon static ( isometric, constant force ) contractions of the muscles ( 8 ). Some have investigated dynamic ( isometric, varying force level ) contractions ( 5, 12 ). When only static contractions are considered, variational calculus techniques can be employed [MASK_NOLOSS] assumption leads to an averaging filter as the optimal filter. The output of an averaging filter is the arithmetic mean of a fixed time history of the signal. The resulting filter is not optimal for dynamic conditions, however. A better approach is to use a variable time-constant filter in which the time constant changes with the signal, that is, an adaptive filter ( 3, 10, 11, 15, 16 ).   Several researchers have investigated the use of multiple detectors on a single muscle to improve the signal-to-noise ratio ( 6, 8, 13, 14 ). Multiple detectors ( spatial filters ) require additional hardware and are complex to implement in clinical prosthetic devices. Therefore, methods to simplify spatial filters in the clinical setting are needed if those filters are to be used clinically. Adaptive filtering   The basic idea behind overcoming the EMG filter paradox is to vary the time',\n",

In general, miniature electronic transducers proved difficult to position accurately, are expensive, and are not readily available in matrix configurations that could be applied to the needs of this study. Also, reports of hysteresis problems, contamination by tangential forces, and electrical interference discouraged use of miniature electronic devices.   Preliminary trials were conducted with the TIPE device first developed at the Texas Institute for Rehabilitation Research in Houston, Texas ( 15 ). The device uses a 12 x 12 pneumatic transducers matrix, which is attractive because of the large surface area it covers. However, the maximum pressure of 150 mmHg was found inadequate. Also, consistent problems were encountered with the electrical contacts within the transducers. And finally, no calibration method is provided with the TIPE system, making it difficult to conduct routine calibrations.   Suggestions have been made that accuracy is improved when a single transducers cell is attached directly to the skin over an ischial [MASK_NOLOSS] surface. The radiographic results show that the ischial tuberosities shift approximately 4 cm during the complete range of movements studied. Therefore, the single-cell skin method is not appropriate for experiments in which large changes in trunk positions are to be studied.   Finally, 3 years of previous experience had shown the OPM to be a reliable and durable device that provides reasonably accurate results within known limitations. Linearity and variability tests have been done and published by the developers ( 20, 21 ). The OPM is commercially available, and for this and the above reasons it was chosen as the most appropriate pressure-measurement system to use in the study. Furthermore, the fundamental approach of using relative rather than absolute values with the same seat cushion means that the errors associated with the OPM at least will be consistent and therefore largely self-canceling ( 23 ).

This infolding occurs in response to elevated circulating concentrations of estrogens produced [MASK_NOLOSS], Mead et al. 1981 ). Thus, recruitment of shell glands in the uterus occurs before pregnancy, during the follicular growth phase ( vitellogenesis ), rather than during pregnancy. The loss of the shell is not due to selective forces acting on the pregnant female but instead on the female during the follicular growth phase.   A reduction in number of shell glands recruited could happen in response to several different factors : a reduction in circulating estrogen concentrations, a reduction in the number of or a blocking of the estrogen receptors, postreceptor modifications inhibiting activities such as transcription and translation, or a reduction in stem-cell populations that normally give rise to gland cells. Unfortunately, good comparative data for closely related oviparous and viviparous species do not exist to test these possibilities. Other than knowing that gland formation is influenced by estrogens, we understand almost nothing about the process of shell gland recruitment and development in reptiles, or, for that matter, m any oviparous vertebrate.   If a selective force reduces uterine [MASK_NOLOSS] the eggshell, it may be possible to view viviparity as a response to sequential selective events ( one selective event during follicular growth and another during pregnancy ) or one selective force exhibiting an effect throughout the reproductive cycle. Even if the mechanism for shell loss is associated with factors influencing the female in the follicular phase, selection would still need to favor individual pregnant females through differential reproductive success ( increased survival of offspring ), so that over many generations this trait would become genetically fixed. This area requires substantial future research.   Unlike early studies suggesting that a female could retain a shelled egg until it hatched, recent studies indicate that the ability of a reptilian female to retain her embryos throughout their development correlates with the formation of a placenta ( Guillette 1982 ). Placentation is possible because of the reduction in the thickness of the shell, for if the diffusion distance between the maternal and fetal blood supplies is not reduced, so the vascular membranes become apposed, and exchange of gases, water, and [MASK_NOLOSS] maximizes exchange between the mother and developing young. However, the placenta is not unique in allowing exchange ; a reptilian embryo developing in an nestbound egg forms membranous structures that line the inner surface of the eggshell and exchange water and gas with the nest environment ( Figure 4',\n",

Furthermore, Toseland ( 1990 ) and his associates ( Toseland, Rossiter, &; Labrecque, 1989 ) found no differences in outcomes for peer-led groups and professionally led groups for caregivers of frail elderly people in their study, in which participants were randomly assigned to two treatment conditions, peer-led and professionally led groups, and to a control, no-treatments condition.   These publications provide insights into the operation of specific types of support groups and some evaluation of their benefits. They offer limited conceptual guidance about the factors that affect group performance and outcomes. All of the reports of support groups, however, relate to successful group experiences. Discussion of group problems, ethical and legal issues, and negative consequences of participation are notably lacking in these accounts.   Our review of the [MASK_NOLOSS] processes and outcomes must consider internal and external factors that affect these groups and their interaction. Reviews of the theoretical literature related to social support indicate that conceptualizing social supports that address stresses experienced in the environment requires an interactional approach that takes account of both environmental and individual characteristics ( Israel &; Rounds, 1987 ; Shumaker &; Brownell, 1984 ). Toseland et al. ( 1989 ) cited the usefulness of an ecological systems framework for guiding interventions in support groups for caregivers of frail elderly people.

OPEN SYSTEMS MODEL OF SUPPORT GROUPS   The proposed open systems model of support groups is a framework capable of integrating existing perspectives and advancing the conceptualization of support groups. In this model, which is based on an ecological perspective, support group conditions are viewed as an adaptation to external conditions and participant characteristics confronting each group system ( Figure 1 ). Differences in external conditions and participant characteristics are expected to be associated with differences in group conditions and variations in outcomes. Furthermore, the outcomes constitute feedback to the system, and this feedback affects future external and internal conditions. A description of each of the conceptual dimensions provides the basis for understanding support groups as open systems.

Measures   Glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA 1 ), used to measure the child's level of metabolic control, was an indicator of the health status of the participants. HbA 1 provides an estimate of blood glucose over an eight-week period ( Epstein et al., 1981 ). Reports from previous studies indicated that HbA 1 is less likely to be influenced by daily fluctuations in blood sugars and is more reliable than random or isolated blood glucose tests to determine diabetic control ( Goner, Rubenstein, Rochman, Tanega, &; Horwitz, 1977 ). In the authors'laboratory, HbA 1 is measured in saline-incubated samples using [MASK_NOLOSS] 1 in nondiabetic children is 5.9 percent + 0.64 percent. Higher HbA 1 values correspond with poorer metabolic control ; thus, the mean HbA 1 reported in diabetic youths is higher than the mean in the nondiabetic population.   A confounding disease variable in the relationship between family variables and metabolic control is the residual capacity to produce insulin in diabetic children who are in various stages of remission ( Clarson, Daneman, Drash, Becker, &; Ehrlich, 1987 ). Serum C peptide is a radioimmunoassay technique that measures the amount of endogenous insulin produced by the pancreatic beta-cells. In the current study, C peptide secretion in response to Sustacal ( a standardized liquid meal ) was assessed to determine the level of beta-cell function of the diabetic children.

       " '[YEAR:1993]A retrovirus infecting Panamanian Indians may provide new clues about the first Americans   In 1981, Yorio Hinuma and other researchers in Japan were in hot pursuit of the cause of a fatal blood cancer called adult T-cell leukemia, or ATL. First recognized in 1977, the disease was most common in southwestern Japan, where about seventy cases were diagnosed each year. Its symptoms included enlargement of the lymph nodes and other internal organs, skin and bone disease, and abnormal white blood cells, or leukocytes. Treatment was generally ineffective, and the victims frequently died within one year.   The researchers discovered that the cause of the disease was a virus that had only recently been noticed by U.S. scientists. Christened human T-lymphotropic virus, or HTLV, it garnered particular attention not only because of its potential significance in cancer research but also because this was the first known example of human infection with a retrovirus -- an RNA virus that changes its genetic material into DNA and inserts it into the DNA of the host organism. The HTLV virus targeted the white blood cells, [MASK_NOLOSS] HTLV was discovered, scientists began perfecting laboratory techniques for detecting its presence. Antibodies against the virus could be found in the blood of those with adult T-cell leukemia, as well as in many other people. In southwestern Japan, about 15 percent of people tested had the virus. ( We now know that only 2 to 4 percent of those infected develop ATL. )   In 1982, U.S. scientists discovered a similar virus, distinguishable from the original only through elaborate testing. The two viruses were then named HTLV-I and HTLV-II. We still do not know whether the second causes disease.   Interest in these viruses mounted in 1984, when a third retrovirus was found to be the cause of a much more threatening disease -- AIDS ( see \" The Natural History of AIDS, \" Natural History, May 1986 ). Some favored calling the AIDS virus HTLV-III, but because it acts differently -- by causing a failure of the immune system -- it is now known as human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV. [MASK_NOLOSS] have continued to provide surprises of their own.

( Africans and New Guineans are also sufficiently similar in hair form and other respects that, when I tried to take a New Guinea friend to lunch in a segregated Virginia restaurant in 1964, we were asked to leave. ) Conversely, modern Europeans, speaking related languages and probably sharing a common genetic ancestry, exhibit a striking gradient in skin color from north to south. Perhaps natural selection, rather than conversion and intermarriage, similarly accounts for the north-to-south gradient in skin color of Jews.   Another argument for natural selection is the rate of G6PD deficiency among Jews and their \" host \" populations. As in most warm areas of the Old World, malaria was formerly a major health problem around the Mediterranean. In response to this chronic, life-threatening danger, Old World peoples evolved various \" [MASK_NOLOSS] the sickle-cell hemoglobin of Africans. These genetic traits offer some protection against malaria -- but at a cost, usually a tendency toward anemia ( see my article in the February 1989 issue of Natural History ). While the benefits outweigh the costs in heterozygotes ( people inheriting the gene from just one parent ), the anemia often proves to be crippling or even fatal in homozygotes ( people inheriting the gene from both parents ). In malarial environments, the antimalarial benefits to the more numerous heterozygotes offset the severe disadvantage to the far less numerous homozygotes. Take away malaria, though, and all benefits of the gene disappear.   An example of that effect of natural selection is provided by today\\'s U.S. blacks. The antimalarial sickle-cell gene in them is less prevalent than it is in African populations from which we know that blacks in the United States are descended.

In the few centuries that blacks have been in the Americas, natural selection has apparently already eliminated some of their original heritage of sickle-cell genes.   For Mediterranean peoples such as the original Jews, G6PD deficiency rather than sickle-cell is one of the leading genetic antimalarials. Nevertheless, the reasoning is otherwise similar to that in the case of New World blacks. When Jews arrived in malaria-free Eastern Europe, they would have tended gradually to lose the G6PD-deficiency gene, even if they had never intermarried or made converts. That Russian and German Gentiles also lack this gene does not mean that the populations are related ; the [MASK_NOLOSS] has the similar skin pigmentation of black Africans and New Guineans.   But what about the ABO blood groups, which were formerly assumed to be neutral genetic indicators of racial origins? They too are subject to natural selection because they resemble ( are mimicked by? ) the antigens of some bacteria. In consequence, people with certain ABO blood types seem less able to develop antibodies against certain bacteria, and more susceptible to diseases caused by those bacteria, than people with a different ABO blood group. The evidence is strongest for smallpox susceptibility of people with blood group A ( see Natural History, February 1990, \" A Pox upon Our Genes \" ).

Each of the two 250-meter-long linear arms of the [MASK_NOLOSS] arms are connected by arcs, forming an overall shape rather like that of a racetrack. ( See the figures on pages 17 and 19. ) The beam will circulate up to five times through the racetrack, so that any given cross section may have electrons at five different energies. Since the electrons will all be moving at essentially the speed of light, the different-energy components of the beam will stay in phase in the linear arms.   The main barrier to increasing the beam energy beyond 4 GeV comes from the arcs : A few of the magnets that bend the beam, and many of their power supplies, are at present designed for a maximum of 4 GeV. It is anticipated that upgrading the beam from 4 to 6 GeV will take a year ; the roughly $1 million needed may come from the accelerator improvement budget. Further upgrades will also require supplementing the refrigeration system and some of the detectors. An energy of 8 GeV is foreseen five or so years down the road. \" How [MASK_NOLOSS] motivation for',\n",
       " '[YEAR:1993] 1900. In the 1880s, however, serious questions concerning the inheritance of acquired characteristics began to be raised by August Weismann ( 1889 ).   Weismann made clear the distinction between somatoplasm and germ plasm. He recognized that the continuity of heredity is maintained in the germ line and by the gametes in isolation from the some. It seemed impossible that modifications of characteristics acquired in the tissues could influence the hereditary message carried forward in the germ line. ( The argument is much less compelling in plants, where asexual, vegetative propagation is a common occurrence ).   To demonstrate the fallacy of the idea of inheritance of acquired characteristics, Weismann performed an influential experiment : he cut off the tails of male and female mice in five successive generations, thereby creating and reinforcing the acquired trait of taillessness. But even afterfive generations, all of 901 offspring sported complete and normal tails ( Weismann 1889 ).   After Weismann, understanding of the mechanisms of inheritance progressed steadily. Important milestones were [MASK_NOLOSS] the development of the concept of mutation by Hugo De Vries and others ( ca. 1902 ), the connection between the hereditary units of Mendel and cytologically observed chromosomes ( by W. Sutton and others cat 1902 ), and the adoption of Drosophila as a chief vehicle of genetic experimentation by T. H. Morgan ( 1910 ). The concept of inheritance of acquired characteristics could not be accommodated in Drosophila genetics, the dominant line of genetic research before 1940. To quote Morgan ( 1932 ), \" It is somewhat depressing to give so much time to destructive criticism of a doctrine that makes wide popular appeal. It sometimes seems as if everybody wanted to believe in the inheritance of acquired characteristics.... It is part of the role of science to destroy pernicious superstitions. \"   In the distinct, rapidly developing field of microbial genetics ( much of it single-cell genetics ), the issue of acquired characteristics had not been resolved : clearly, in microbial systems, any acquired changes in heredity are not relegated to a germ line [MASK_NOLOSS] exposed to the environmental stress. A culture of bacteria exposed to attack by bacteriophage rapidly becomes phage resistant. Did this happen because the phage induced a mass heritable change or because rare resistant mutants multiplied to overgrow the culture? This question was posed by Luria and Delbruck ( 1943 ), and it was answered in an apparently unambiguous way : the culture was overgrown by phage-resistant mutants that were present before any phage were added.',\n",

This question was posed by Luria and Delbruck ( 1943 ), and it was answered in an apparently unambiguous way : the culture was overgrown by phage-resistant mutants that were present before any phage were added.   The rise to power of the agronomist T. D. Lysenko in the Soviet Union in the 1930s revived the discussion of the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Lysenko gained Stalin\\'s backing by promising to improve crop yields much more quickly than could traditional plant geneticists. He claimed that by cold treatment ( vernalization ) he could transform winter wheat into spring wheat. Vernalization proved to be a costly failure. After 1936, when 7 million hectares were planted with vernalized seed, vernalization was quietly and abruptly abandoned ( Rolls-Hansen 1985 ; also see note added in proof, page 705 ).   Lysenko [MASK_NOLOSS] of dialectical materialism applied to genetics : that all matter was in a state of continuing change and, consequently, there could not be stable hereditary traits independent of the environment. He asserted that genes did not exist and that, in the Soviet Union, \" nurture must take charge of nature. \"   The foremost Mendelian geneticist of the USSR, N. I. Vavilov, labeled Lysenko\\'s \" new genetics \" an \" outbreak of medieval obscurantism \" ( Ashby 1947 ). Vavilov and many other Soviet geneticists paid with their lives for opposing Lysenko. Lysenko\\'s ascendancy was based entirely on political intrigue, denunciation and intimidation of scientific opponents as \" class enemies, \" and denigration of \" bourgeois capitalist \" genetics and geneticists. In the 34 years he wielded power, he and his followers never offered believable experimental evidence to support their claims of environmentally induced heritable changes ( Medvedev 1969, Zirke 1949 ).   The complete politicization of genetics in the USSR evoked a shocked but also political response in the West ( [MASK_NOLOSS] following statement, issued by the Governing Board of the American Institute of',\n",

Had Luria and Delbruck used phage lambda for their fluctuation test rather than the virulent phage T1, they would have found that a large proportion of the infected E. cold had acquired phage resistance as a result of prior exposure to lambda ( actually immunity due to Iysogenization ). ( Recently, experiments by Cairns et al. 1988 and by Hall 1991 have raised yet a different challenge to Luria and Delbruck\\'s conclusions : these authors describe experiments suggesting that media containing particular substrates somehow induce a greatly increased number of mutations adaptive to these substrates. An **27;115;TOOLONG mechanism has not been pinpointed so far Lenski and Mittler 1993. )   The exploration of many acquired inheritance systems, starting with the discovery of heat-induced curing of Euglena chloroplasts by Ternitz ( 1912 ), [MASK_NOLOSS] they were premature discoveries that were not understood and consequently ignored by most of the scientific establishment ( Stent 1972 ). The \" rear experimental and conceptual advances in molecular genetics that were needed to understand acquired inheritance systems were made after 1945. Thus, understanding of the mechanisms of gene transcription and transcription controls ( developed during the 1960s ) is crucial to understanding the mechanisms of extranucleic acquired inheritance systems. Similarly, the identification of mitochondria, chloroplasts, plasmids, and temperate viruses as self-replicating nucleic-acid-containing genetic elements ( starting in the mid-1950s ) was needed to understand the mechanisms of nucleic aquired inheritance systems. Exploration of DNA methylation and glucosylation-required to understand epinucleic inheritance -- came only in the late 1960s.   The study of single-cell systems has shown that extranucleic and epinucleic traits can be induced and stably inherited in single cells. But so far as I know now, only changes in nucleic systems can be transmitted through the germ line.   It is evident that the phenomenon that I have called inheritance of acquired characteristics greatly [MASK_NOLOSS] held by Hippocrates, Lamarck, and Lysenko. If anything, some of the persistent changes in traits induced by brief treatments are more sudden, pervasive, and permanent than those envisaged by the historical proponents of the idea of inheritance of acquired characteristics. The mechanisms that we now know to be responsible for acquired changes in inheritance were, of course, remote from the conceptual universes of these men.

If these organisms are grown in the lab at 95 Celsius and then immediately moved to 108 Celsius, they die off. But, Baross and his colleagues have found that, if ES4 gets acclimated to 102 Celsius, it can tolerate temperatures of 105 Celsius. Its tolerance may be due to ES4\\'s increased production of a novel 98-kilodalton protein.   Numerous other single-celled and multicelled organisms make heat-shock proteins to either repair or dismantle proteins damaged by abrupt increases in temperature. The 98-kilodalton protein is the [MASK_NOLOSS] colleagues are now trying to determine the relationships between heat-shock responses and pressure. Preliminary studies indicate that the heat-shock response is delayed when pressure is elevated.   Bartlett, who is studying the pressure adaptations of mesophilic and barophilic organisms, has found that when the mesophile Escherichia cold experiences a sharp pressure increase to 546 atm, its cell division and protein synthesis are upset. Although total protein synthesis falls, 55 proteins are produced at relatively higher rates. These pressure-induced proteins, or PIPS, included heat-shock, cold-shock, and one completely novel protein. Even though E. coli is well studied, \" give it a new, weird situation, and it produces a new protein, \" says Bartlett.   How individual enzymes of mesophilic bacteria E. coli and Micrococcus luteus react to pressure is also under evaluation. Bartlett and his colleagues have found that the activities of DNA gyrases from E. coli and M. luteus are inhibited at pressures well above atmospheric pressure. But the gyrase from M. luteus is more sensitive. Inhibition was pronounced [MASK_NOLOSS] stimulated up to 272 atm, and it was inhibited above 544 atm. High pressure inhibits the activity of both gyrases by pushing their subunits apart.   The gyrases of both species performed better when magnesium was present in growth solutions. \" Magnesium may be important in keeping the gyrase together, \" says Bartlett. Magnesium electrostricts water molecules, leading to a reduction in water volume associated with the enzyme. Other metals have a similar effect, which leads scientists to speculate about their role in regulating pressure tolerance, particularly for deepwater microorganisms. Bartlett and his colleagues now plan to study DNA gyrases from barophiles to determine their stability at high pressures.   Using the',\n",

Because the pre-core mutant takes many years to emerge from the \" wild type \" HBV, both wild type and pre-core mutant may well be transmitted [MASK_NOLOSS] probably selected by the host\\'s immune response and exogenous factors, including interferon-a ( IFN Alpha ) therapy.   Variations of the mid-core region of the HBV genome have been reported to be associated with the development of active liver disease in chronic HBV infection in Japan, ( n18 ) but we have not seen this in US whites.   Tumour necrosis factor-Alpha ( TNF Alpha ) and IFN Alpha and Gamma inhibit the HBV core/genomic and pre-S 1 promoters in cell culture, but in patients with chronic HBV infection TNF Alpha had either no effect or increased the amount of circulating HBV and HBsAg. ( n19 ) IFN Gamma has little inhibitory effect on circulating HBV. ( n20 )   The information on viral replication is important for drug design. So far, however, agents which inhibit DNA synthesis and reduce HBV replication, once they are withdrawn, are followed by HBV recurrence. The cccDNA molecules in the nuclei of hepatocytes seem to be very stable. Non-hepatic sites of virus replication, such as peripheral blood lymphocytes and spleen [MASK_NOLOSS] of viral persistence   Viral persistence is probably related to a specific failure of T cells to recognise HBV antigens. This assumption is supported by the clinical observation that patients with a relative deficit in T-cell function ( the young, the aged, and the immunosuppressed ) are more prone to develop chronic HBV infection. In-vitro peripheral blood T cell activation is impaired in patients with chronic HBV infection but this is not associated with clinical evidence of immune deficiency, suggesting a redistribution of primed T cells from the circulation to the liver.   The demonstration that IFN Alpha can eliminate active HBV replication raises the possibility that chronic HBV carriage may be secondary to IFN Alpha deficiency. IFN Alpha is rarely detected in the circulation in chronic hepatitis B and virus-stimulated production of IFN Alpha by circulating mononuclear cells is reduced.

Although the hepatic expression of IFN Alpha is lower than that of acute HBV, those with active liver disease had higher hepatic expression of IFN Alpha, suggesting that suboptimal production of IFN Alpha by circulating mononuclear cells may be related to a redistribution of the \" primed \" cells to the liver. Alternatively, the production of IFN Alpha by circulating cells may have been down-regulated during its passage through the liver. ( n24 )   HBV can also reduce the cell\\'s sensitivity to IFN Alpha. When a vector containing HBV was transfected into an IFN Alpha-sensitive cell line, the response to exogenous IFN Alpha was reduced.

What is the specific target for immune attack? It is not easy to study the mechanism of hepatocellular injury in acute HBV infection. In one attempt 5 individuals in the early **25;1584;TOOLONG phase of acute HBV infection were identified by contact tracing and their cellular immune response to HBV antigens was monitored. ( n28 ) Cellular immunity to pre-S developed 30 days before biochemical evidence of liver damage appeared, at a stage when the HBsAg titre was rising and when HBeAg was first detectable. A cellular response to HBcAg followed 10 days later, preceding the humoral response ( anti-HBc IgM ). The cellular response to HBsAg correlated most closely with the onset of biochemical liver damage, suggesting HBsAg as the likely immune target. On the other hand, cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTL ) directed against HBcAg have been identified, [MASK_NOLOSS] Studies with overlapping synthetic peptides have delineated some of the HLA restricted T-cell epitopes ( eg, an HLA-A2 restricted epitope has been mapped to aminoacid residue 18-27 of HBcAg ( n29 ) ) and, recently, aminoacid residues 141-151 to both HLA-A31 and HLA-Aw 68.

Immunohistochemical studies showed that cytoplasmic expression of core, but not surface, correlates with disease activity. ( n32, n33 ) As T cell epitopes are usually 8-10 aminoacids in length, cytoplasmic accumulation of HBcAg may allow proteolytic processing to produce T-cell epitopes that are presented in conjunction with HLA class I molecules.   Study of T-helper cells ( T h ) has identified three [MASK_NOLOSS] and one of these partly overlaps the HLA-A2 restricted CTL epitope referred to above. These studies indicate that HBcAg can be a stimulus for both helper and cytotoxic T cells.   Non-T- lymphocytes also seem to take part in the mediation of hepatocellular damage in chronic infection. Non-T-cell cytotoxicity can be blocked by liver-specific membrane lipoprotein ( LSP ), aggregated IgG, or the F ( ab') 2 fragment of anti-human IgG, suggesting that non-T lymphocytes may direct an antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity against a component of LSP.

However, corticosteroids also have a direct stimulatory effect on viral replication and this may be associated with an increased antigen expression and greater spread through the liver. Upon corticosteroid withdrawal, the immune rebound, coupled with the enhanced viral antigen ( immune target ) expression, may result in severe, even fulminant reactivation. ( n40, n41 ) Rapid reintroduction of corticosteroids followed by gradual withdrawal may alleviate the severe life-threatening reactivation.

With coinfection, the clinical course is usually self-limiting because the HDV can not outlive the transient HBV infection, but with a superinfection, the attack can be very severe. In patients with chronic HBV and HDV coinfection the HDV suppresses HBV replication without significant effect on the expression of HBsAg.

       " '[YEAR:1994]Section : Science and practice   Research on hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) infection is a prime example of the two-way interdependence of clinical practice and molecular biology. The rationale for interferon ( IFN ) in the treatment of chronic HBV infection came from knowledge that this protein is produced in small amounts in response to viral infection. The design of new antiviral agents is dependent on knowledge of HBV replication. The efficacy of treatment of chronic hepatitis B is primarily judged on whether or not HBV DNA disappears from serum, and that is done by molecular hybridisation assays. Such assays also help to select patients with chronic HBV infection for transplantation. Recombinant DNA technology has led to the development of a vaccine and it is molecular biology that has shown that the virus can mutate and so escape this protective strategy.   On the other hand clinical research can support scientific findings. For example, the liver transplant model has provided insight into mechanisms of viral hepatic damage ; differences in susceptibility to chronicity between vertically and horizontally acquired HBV infection provide clues to immunological function at different ages [MASK_NOLOSS] liver failure plus very high levels of HBV DNA in carriers with little evidence of liver damage suggest that it is the immune response, not the virus, which is the prime mediator of liver damage. Epidemiology, natural history, and transmission   Acute HBV infection is usually mild and the risk of chronicity in immunocompetent adults is less than 5%. However, this risk is greatly increased in the newborn ( up to 90% ) and the immunocompromised, such as transplant recipients or those with concomitant HIV infection. Acute infection may also on occasion lead to fulminant liver failure, with a case fatality rate of 80%. Most patients with chronic infection have normal liver enzymes, no symptoms, and normal or near normal liver histology. These \" healthy \" carriers seem to be immunologically tolerant to this virus, and the prognosis is excellent, ( n1 ) but when there is a loss of tolerance with emergence of reactive T cell clones, hepatic inflammation and T-cell-mediated liver damage may ensue.

       " \"[YEAR:1994]A pilot study   Abstract -- A small-scale trial is described to demonstrate and evaluate the redistribution of plantar pressure resulting from the use of custom-molded inserts in the orthopedic shoes of diabetic patients at risk of plantar ulceration. A pressure-measuring insole based on force-sensitive resistor technology enabled the load distribution to be compared using molded inserts and flat inserts fitted into the same shoes. An analysis of the 12 peaks of pressure that could be identified under a discrete metatarsal head of six subjects in the trial showed that the pressure was significantly reduced with the use of molded inserts ( flat inserts : 305 +/- 79 kPa ; molded inserts : 216 +/- 70 kPa ; n = 6 p<0.005 ). Technical limitations of the equipment and the difficult choice of match of flat insert to molded for comparison suggest that further studies are required for a definitive result.   Key words : diabetes, foot, gait, insole sensors, molded inserts, neuropathy, plantar pressure, pressure sores. INTRODUCTION   It has been demonstrated that diabetic patients with a history of neuropathic plantar ulceration have abnormally high pressures [MASK_NOLOSS] of pressure occur most frequently under the metatarsal heads and correlate frequently with the sites of ulceration. Reduction of the pressure peaks can be achieved by providing special shoes ( 4 ), which form an important part of an effective management program for the neuropathic foot. The deep inserts normally provided in these shoes may be either flat or molded to the contours of the patient's foot.   Flat inserts are made of a soft material that provides local cushioning in the metatarsal region to replace the natural fat pad that has been lost or displaced distally. The action of this cushioning is to spread the loading of each head out over a larger local area. Lower-density grades of Plastazote(R), a closed-cell polyethylene foam, are commonly used and described for this purpose by Tuck ( 5 ). Other materials used include PPT(R), an open-cell foam ; Sorbothane(R), a viscoelastic polymer ; and Spenco(R), a closed-cell neoprene sponge. Although flat inserts have been demonstrated to reduce abnormally high pressure peaks, an insert of practicable thickness may [MASK_NOLOSS] severe cases to within a normal range ( 6 ).

Although flat inserts have been demonstrated to reduce abnormally high pressure peaks, an insert of practicable thickness may [MASK_NOLOSS] severe cases to within a normal range ( 6 ). The alternative, molded inserts, are contoured usually against a cast or impression of the foot. These are often described as providing a redistribution of the load away from the metatarsal region, primarily due to increased support under the midfoot. Molded inserts are often made of a sandwich construction, with a firm base such as high-density Plastazote ( e.g., hard black grade HD115 1 ) and cushioning upper.   The pressure-relieving effect of molded vs. flat inserts has not been compared scientifically, primarily due to the previous lack of measurement techniques. Methods of measurement and clinical applications of foot pressure have been extensively reviewed by the authors ( 7, 8 ) and others ( 9, 10 ). Most of the early techniques were limited to barefoot measurements, often in a static situation, or else severely restricted by bulky transducers. A resurgence of interest has been stimulated recently by new technology that can now provide a flexible insole to measure in-shoe pressures during walking. [MASK_NOLOSS] Analysis System 2 used in this study.   This study evaluates the reduction in peak pressure obtained by patients attending the Diabetic Foot Centre at King's College Hospital London through the use of their routine custom-molded inserts. Comparison is made with a soft flat insert placed in the same shoes to minimize effects due to shoe design. The study was undertaken as a pilot, because of the developmental nature of the F-Scan equipment at that time. METHODS Patients and their Footwear   The patients were identified from those routinely attending the diabetic foot clinic. After the start of the trial, the first patients who were selected had the following criteria : wore custom-made orthopedic shoes with molded inserts had inserts that were still serviceable had one foot at least free of gross deformity ( e.g., Charcot joints, ray amputations ) had no recent foot surgery had no major skin lesions ( i.e., open plantar ulcers ) requiring padded dressings were able to walk una\",\n",
       " \"[YEAR:1994]5<p<l ; n = 5 ). Since there is no apparent reason to suggest that all patients would stand with their balance consistently offset in the anteroposterior direction at the end of the trial, these results are consistent with no significant instrumentation drift. Comparison of Flat and Molded Inserts   The cadence of the first walk with each treatment was analyzed from the timing over two whole strides. The cadences in steps per minute were as follows : flat inserts, mean 97.3, SD 13.1, range from 77 to 114 ; molded inserts, mean 100.5, SD 10.5, range from 85 to 117. The worst difference between cadences was 8 steps per minute, presenting a 10 percent change ; the average change was 5 percent, with two cases of slightly reduced cadence and [MASK_NOLOSS] make this comparison on the basis of the relief provided only under metatarsal heads that displayed discrete peaks of pressure. The F-Scan recordings were first inspected to identify sites where a peak could clearly be distinguished ( i.e., where a localized area of high pressure could be seen in the region of one metatarsal head, such as those identified in Figure 4 ). Because these recordings were all taken with a high degree of cushioning present that would tend to smooth peaks, only 13 such peaks could be safely identified in the six patients'records. Every patient showed at least two peaks : always a peak under the first metatarsal head, and the other peak under either the second or third head. The remaining additional peak was identified on one patient under the fourth head, which for reasons of performing a valid statistical analysis, was excluded.   There existed considerable variability in pressure level at one site between successive steps of each walk ( Table 2 ). To be consistent, the authors followed a fixed protocol [MASK_NOLOSS] the flat insert and the first recording with the molded insert, three complete steps were used for analysis in every case. The sequence of foot pressure maps representing the footstep was inspected visually to determine the spatial location of any metatarsal pressure peak, most evident at the push-off phase of gait. Peak pressures are read as an average over nine adjacent cells ( i.e., over a square area of 15 mm x 15 mm ). This spatial averaging is used to minimize the variability from cell-to-cell calibration inaccuracies, although it is recognized that this also has the effect of reducing the true value of peak pressure due to spatial smoothing.

Peak pressures are read as an average over nine adjacent cells ( i.e., over a square area of 15 mm x 15 mm ). This spatial averaging is used to minimize the variability from cell-to-cell calibration inaccuracies, although it is recognized that this also has the effect of reducing the true value of peak pressure due to spatial smoothing. However, this is not so deleterious when recording foot loading onto deep cushioning, where the pressure profiles are considerably smoother than on a harder surface. The maximum value with respect to time under each identified peak was then recorded for each step.   On this basis, a mean maximum peak pressure of 305+/-79 kPa was obtained for the fiat PPT inserts. This was significantly higher than [MASK_NOLOSS] for the molded inserts, 216+/-70 kPa ( p<0.005 ; n = 6 ). In the significance tests, note that n = 6 and not 12 because the two peaks under each foot for each condition were not independent and were therefore averaged for analysis. By inspecting the maximum pressures recorded during each footstep, the authors observed that the reduction of maximum pressures under the forefoot peaks was often associated with pressure redistribution into the midfoot. DISCUSSION   To obtain a conclusive result from any plantar pressure trials with orthopedic footwear has in the past proved difficult, due to the number of variables to be controlled, instrumentation constraints, and the problem of comparing like with like. This trial is no exception. For reasons of cost, patients were tested with their supplied molded inserts, which were of varying constructions and ages. The details of the footwear were not recorded, and although these were all of a similar lace-up type supplied by the same company, there were no doubt some differences. The instrumentation was observed to [MASK_NOLOSS] calibrations against weight varying from the beginning to the end of each trial. It can not be determined to what extent this was due to cell drop-outs rather than a general drift in all cells. The numbers of subjects were reduced by loss of data from the pressure-measuring insole due to creasing. Finally, there must be compromises in the design of a flat insert to \" match \" the molded insert.   Nevertheless, the trial was designed to test a single hypothesis',\n",

The amount of terminal weight required by the Ice Platform is based on the cable length and the anticipated relative motion between ice and water. GAUGING ICE THICKNESS   The Ice Platform is equipped with an Ice Staff that can detect changes in ice thickness by measuring the temperature at 24 closely spaced depths ( 10 centimeters apart ) between the ice surface and the base of the staff. The Ice Staff is attached to the Ice Platform by a 0.5-inch cable with a urethane jacket and a watertight 50-pin connector on the upper collar of the buoy housing.   The subsurface portion of the Ice Staff is a wooden rod, 2.5 inches in diameter, 7.5 feet long, with a slot tooled along its entire length. Temperature sensors and their wiring are embedded into this slot by a layer of epoxy resin spread as thinly as possible to ensure effective thermal coupling with the ice. The sensors are 0.2 degrees [MASK_NOLOSS].   Signals from the temperature sensors in the Ice Staff are sent by a circular connector on a junction box to an umbilical cable that carries them to a corresponding connector on the Ice Platform. The junction box can be fitted snugly in the ice by chipping out the top 2 inches of the hole drilled to accommodate the Ice Platform sensing cable.   D-cell batteries made of alkaline-manganese dioxide power the Ice Platform battery pack because these yield greater capacity and low-temperature performance than standard retail batteries. The battery pack consists of 16 groups of 12 ( nominally 18 volts each ) wired in parallel via isolating diodes. This configuration prevents accidental self-discharge of the pack if any batter?'stick fails.   Data acquisition and processing units collect the analog signals from the Ice Platform sensors.

Fuel electrodes, which are made from nickel, must not only be porous to allow easy access for fuel flowing to the electrolyte but also must be effective electrical conductors. Similarly, the lanthanum manganite air electrode must be a good conductor and porous enough for oxygen to pass through it.   Westinghouse is developing the solid-oxide cell in a $140 million program that involves the U.S. Department of Energy and electric utilities in Canada, Japan, and the United States. Westinghouse already has tested [MASK_NOLOSS] to nearly six years of actual use. The individual cells have exceeded performance expectations, with only 0.5 percent voltage degradation over 1000 operating hours.   In February 1992, Westinghouse delivered a 25-kilowatt demonstration unit to a consortium of Kansai Electric Power Co. in Osaka, Tokyo Gas Co., and Osaka Gas Co. Early next year the company will ship a 20-kilowatt demonstration unit based on its most advanced fuel-cell design to a consortium of Osaka Gas Co. and Tokyo Gas Co. Later in 1995 the company expects to ship a similar fuel cell module to Southern California Edison, and in mid-1996 it plans to deliver a 100-kilowatt cogeneration system to a consortium of European utilities.   Until 1992, Westinghouse developed both phosphoric acid and solid-oxide fuel cells. But the company stopped developing the phosphoric acid power plant because \" there\\'s greater potential for a significant business from solid-oxide fuel cells, \" said Walter Dollard, general manager of the advanced energy conversion division at Westinghouse.   Phosphoric acid cells are around 40 percent efficient and operate [MASK_NOLOSS] temperatures of up to 1000 Degree C, the solid-oxide power plant will be at least 50 to 60 percent efficient in combined cycles.   This design will also be simple to operate because it uses a solid electrolyte, and its high temperatures can be used to reform the fuel. Moreover, the fuel cell system has few moving parts ( an air blower, a fuel pump, and a few valves ), which will hold down maintenance and manufacturing costs. PHOSPHORIC ACID POWER PLANTS   International Fuel Cell\\'s phosphoric acid power plant generates not only electric power but also roughly 750,000 British thermal units per hour -- enough heat to meet thermal needs',\n",

One fuel cell has operated for 315 days without being shut down, and a second has run for one year, available for use 99.7 percent of the time. PEM FUEL-CELL ENGINE   Ballard Power Systems is developing a proton-exchange-membrane fuel cell that uses a polymer-membrane electrolyte bonded between two carbon electrodes coated with a platinum catalyst. The fuel cell produces electricity, heat, and water when hydrogen is sent to the anode anti oxygen is sent to the cathode. Ballard has already demonstrated a 20- passenger bus powered by a PEM fuel cell engine. In this demonstration prototype, the fuel cells were more than twice the size of those required in a commercial bus. Ballard\\'s objective was merely to demonstrate that a fuel-cell-powered bus could perform as well as one powered by a diesel engine.   For simplicity, the company\\'s engineers decided to store compressed hydrogen gas on board the vehicle, instead of using a chemical reformer to convert another fuel to hydrogen. One option considered [MASK_NOLOSS] vehicle\\'s motors into electric power generators. Such a system would capture some of the energy normally lost by braking and make it available for further use. According to Ballard\\'s calculations, however, a braking bus that is fully loaded and operates at city speeds generates between 300 and 500 kilowatts. A battery accepting that much power would add too much weight to the vehicle.   Ballard is now developing a 275-horsepower bus engine that fits into the diesel engine compartment of a bus. Regenerated energy. will be channeled to resistors and used for heating. The fuel cell\\'s size and weight has been cut in half compared to the first prototype. Ballard believes the bus will be operating by mid-1995 ; a commercial prototype may be ready by 1998.   The company is also developing fuel cells suitable for automobiles. These must be half the size, half the weight, and have the same power output as Ballard\\'s new bus engine. Moreover, a delicate balance must be struck between the size, weight [MASK_NOLOSS] To decide where to refine the design you have to look at the overall drive system, \" said Keith Prater, vice president of technology at Ballard.

Their only hope lay in the Molly Maguires, a secret band of Irish terrorists. \" 54 In other words, they had a just cause, but they were still terrorists. The end did not justify the means. Nonetheless, it was the enemies of the Molly Maguires who were now portrayed as the unremittingly evil, particularly Franklin B. Gowen of the Reading Railroad and Captain Davies ( i.e., Linden ) of the Coal and Iron Police.   The undermining of the old negative mythology was most evident in the portrayal of Detective McParlan, played by Richard Harris. Whereas Captain Davies emerged as something of a caricature, a plot device through which to convey the idea of pure evil, McParlan was a complex and tortured figure, and his character was drawn in far greater detail than any other. \" You\\'re a detective, \" Davies told McParlan at one point. \" Don\\'t be polite, Captain, \" McParlan said bluntly. \" I\\'m an informer. \" 55 Well aware [MASK_NOLOSS] Irish in the anthracite region, he dealt with his guilt by distancing himself from his Irish roots and concentrating on his own self-advancement. His assignment in the coal fields turned out to be the perfect opportunity for him to fulfill his ambition, for he was told in advance that his reward for bringing the Molly Maguires to justice would be an appointment as head of the Pinkerton Detective Agency\\'s office in Colorado. 56 As a result, he was prepared to use all means necessary to fulfil his task, to the extent of planning and even participating in Molly Maguire assassinations.   In the climactic scene, McParlan went to visit John Kehoe in his death-cell. \" You came for absolution, \" Kehoe informed McParlan. \" You \\'d like to be free from what you\\'ve done.... Punishment, that\\'s what you want. You think punishment\\'s all that can set you free.

There\\'s no punishment this side of hell can free you from what you did. \" 58   The intriguing aspect of this scene, and the film in general, is the extent to which the interpretation of the Molly Maguires continued to be shaped by contemporary events rather than simply portraying past reality. In part, the movie represented Hollywood\\'s attempt to deal with the violence and radicalism of the late 1960s, in particular the Weather-men. 59 But the portrayal of the informer as a pariah also bore a direct relation to the lingering bitterness in Hollywood over McCarthyism. The movie\\'s director, Martin Ritt, and its writer, Walter Bernstein, had been blacklisted for refusing to \" name names \" during the investigations. instigated in the early 1950s by the House Committee on un-American Activities. Their portrayal of McParlan can therefore be seen as a pointed criticism [MASK_NOLOSS] against subversion. 60   If the old negative mythology had been demolished in popular culture, it was also under concerted attack by certain descendants of the Molly Maguires in the anthracite region. After a campaign waged by his niece and grand-nephew, the alleged Molly Maguire ringleader John Kehoe was granted a posthumous pardon on 12 January, 1979. Then, on 21 June, 1980 -- exactly one hundred and three years after \" Black Thursday, \" when ten Molly Maguires had been executed on a single day -- a plaque was dedicated at Schuylkill County Prison. The pardon of John Kehoe, the plaque noted, reflected \" the judgement of many historians that the trials and executions were part of a repression directed against the fledgling mineworkers\\'union of that historic period. \" 61 Since 1980 the Molly Maguires have awaited their next novelist. 62   \\n',\n",

Ansoff ( 1974 ) remarked that business managers, as practitioners, have sought a guide to decision-making processes that could help them deal with the \" growing variability and unpredictability of their environment \" ( p. 11 ).   Social workers can benefit from reviewing Ansoff\\'s work on decision making, because it presents a comprehensive, situationally [MASK_NOLOSS]. Making the necessary adaptations for health care organizations, this article uses Ansoff\\'s model to analyze the types of decision situations encountered by social workers in the health care field. Ansoff ( 1981 ) analyzed decision making by dividing typical decision situations in complex organizations into three categories : ( 1 ) operating, which I call \" operational \" ; ( 2 ) strategic ; and ( 3 ) administrative, which I call \" authoritative. \" To examine the types of decisions most often encountered in health care settings, I use a modified version of Ansoff\\'s typology and add a fourth category -- crisis -- to reflect a type of decision situation that has assumed increasing importance in health care social work ( Murdach, 1987 ).   Using the factors of risk and uncertainty, a four-celled matrix can be constructed that diagrams the interrelationships between these types of decision situations ( Figure 1 ). The labels in each cell represent the four types of clinical decision situations discussed in this article. Although the matrix is an over-simplification [MASK_NOLOSS], it allows the comparison of typical examples of this process of the risk and uncertainty levels occurring in each situation. Operational Decision Situations   Operational decision situations are circumstances defined as recurrent or \" routine. \" Such situations tend to be low in risk and uncertainty. The term \" routine \" does not imply that the situations are trivial, only that they are familiar and frequent. As Selznick ( 1965 ) pointed out, many routine decision situations are extremely important and involve essential work for the organization and its clients.   Case Example. A 52-year-old male psychiatric patient asked the hospital social worker for help in completing the applications for social security disability benefits and Supplemental Security Income. The client said that the severity of his symptoms made it impossible for him to hold a job and that disability benefits would be essential so that he could pay for housing and subsistence once be was discharged.

Less obvious is the consequence of the plethora of available statistical techniques. Powerful off-the-shelf statistical packages offer wide discretion in selecting techniques. Rarely, if ever, does a consensus exist. Different procedures have their partisans, and although the priestly custodians of methodological rigor strive to suppress heresy, unanimity can not be imposed. In principle, this variety should not impede a clear vision of the world. In practice, however, the faddish nature of technique selection and the proliferation of novel procedures means a multiplicity of pictures, the technological equivalent of the blind men fondling not just a single elephant, but roaming an entire zoo : an incoherent chorus emerges though all claim to be touching the same creature.

What is important here, however, is not politicization per se, but how this assault contributes to the malaise. Not all successful political intrusions promote the same psychological impact [MASK_NOLOSS] scholarly organizations can take various forms. The prestige of disciplinary affiliation can be borrowed for political purposes. In the 1950s, for example, left-wing physical scientists organized official-sounding activist groups -- Nuclear Scientists for Peace -- and signed publicized petitions, complete with conspicuous references to organized disciplinary standing, demanding the end of the arms race. Antiwar professors of the 1960s were similarly not bashful about acknowledging academic affiliation and professional accomplishment.

Unfortunately, however, we can only measure the intensity of scattering I(S) proportional to where F(S) 2, whereas F(S) = F exp ( iPsi ) is required for structure determination. This poses the phase problem : How can we evaluate Psi? In answer, a number of practical methods have been devised.   As x-rays have wavelengths on the order of interatomic dimensions, the sensitivity of scattering to structure is keen. On the other hand, the cross sections of x-ray scattering are small, and x-rays ultimately cause damage to organic molecules. Although it is not possible to measure the scattering from an individual molecule, crystals or other periodic arrays of macromolecules can provide a surfeit of scattering. Diffraction from crystals concentrates the scattering exclusively into discrete directions ( reflections ) and amplifies the signal by the multiplicity of the lattice -- there are more than 10 14 aligned molecules in a typical protein crystal. If a diffracted wave were sufficiently strong [MASK_NOLOSS] in multiple scattering events and thereby invalidate equation 1. Here the relative weakness of x-ray scattering is an advantage ; x-ray diffraction can be treated in the Born approximation of single scattering events. Moreover, macromolecular crystals are mosaics of many small, independently coherent blocks such that even large crystals diffract kinematically.   When we consider diffraction from a molecular crystal, equation 1 takes a discrete form. First, diffraction is now restricted to directions meeting the Laue conditions : S multiplied by a = h, S multiplied by b = k, S multiplied by c = l, where h, k and I are integers. This defines a lattice dictated by the crystal parameters a, b and c in a manner reciprocal to the unit-cell dimensions ; that is, spots are closer together as cell lengths get longer. Second, as electronic overlaps between atoms are small enough to be negligible, the integral in equation 1 can be replaced by a sum over the atomic position r j for each atom i in the unit [MASK_NOLOSS] gives its atomic scattering factor f j, which can be precalculated for each atom type from a quantum mechanical description of the electron-density distribution. Finally it is essential to account for atomic mobility, which is done with the Debye-Waller factor defined in the isotropic case by the atomic mobility ( or temperature ) parameter, B j = 8Pi 2 Mu 2, where mu is an atomic displacement along S and the bar indicates averaging. Noting that S = 2s and s = Sin Theta',\n",

Equations 2 and 3 together provide the practical foundation for crystallographic structure analysis. The corresponding relationships for fiber diffraction are more complicated, but similar in essence.   A key strength of crystallography is the distributed character of the information, as is evident in equations 2 and 3. All atoms contribute to each structure factor, and all reflections contribute to each point of electron density. Macromolecular crystallography   Crystallographic structure determinations for biological macromolecules invariably proceed through a sequence of experimental or analytical operations that generate a series of tangible objects of the kind shown in figure 3. Crystals are grown, the x-ray diffraction data are collected, phases are evaluated, an electron-density map is synthesized, an atomic model is fitted to this map and the model is then refined to an optimal match with the observations. The pathway often includes repeated cycles of some of the operations, as in refinement, or shunts into alternative approaches, as in phasing.

Unfortunately, this scenario is usually compounded by inadequate nutritional support. The aim of dietary therapy in ARF is to provide sufficient calories ( 30-50kcal/kg per day ) to avoid catabolism and starvation ketoacidosis, while minimising production of nitrogenous waste. This is best achieved by restricting dietary protein to approximately 0.6-0.8 g/kg per day of protein of high biological value and by providing most calories in [MASK_NOLOSS] ( table 3 ). Higher protein intake is advisable in catabolic patients or those with a prolonged maintenance phase, even if it precipitates the need for dialysis. Indeed, management of nutrition is easier after institution of dialysis when patients are generally prescribed 1.0-1.4 g protein per kg per day, 50% of which should be of high biological value. Vigorous parenteral hyperalimentation has been claimed to improve prognosis in ARF ; however, consistent benefit has yet to be demonstrated in controlled trials.   Infection is the most serious complication of ARF, occurs in 50-90% of cases, and accounts for as many as 75% of deaths. Whether this high frequency reflects defective host immunity or repeated breaches of mucocutaneous barriers ( intravenous cannulae, mechanical ventilation, bladder catheterisation ) is unclear. Anaemia, prolongation of bleeding time, and leukocytosis are common haematological complications of ARF and are usually multifactorial in origin. Factors that contribute to anaemia include haemodilution, inhibition of erythropoiesis, haemolysis, bleeding, reduced red-cell survival time, and, probably, frequent [MASK_NOLOSS] platelet dysfunction, and/or clotting factor abnormalities. Anaemia may require transfusion in patients with symptoms or with active bleeding.

To understand what\\'s happening, one might think of the animal\\'s cell -- known as the host cell -- as a factory.   The crucial host-cell protein fuels the factory machinery and directs it to produce more protein needed by the animal. But if the virus protein, called leader protein, can disable the host-cell protein by splitting it apart, the virus can then commandeer the factory machinery to make the product it most desires : more disease-causing virus.   \" Since the leader protein works by cleaving the host-cell protein, what happens if the host-cell protein is not cleaved? \" asks Grubman. \" The virus then has to compete for use of the cell\\'s mechanisms, and it doesn\\'t grow as quickly.   \" In a live animal, when this happens, the virus grows so slowly that [MASK_NOLOSS] the animal\\'s immune system has already produced antibodies against it and won\\'t let the virus spread to cells where it can cause damage. \"   In tests at PIADC, Grubman and ARS microbiologist Maria E.

Throughout the Great Depression, Miller painstakingly worked at building a beef herd -- and a place to graze it.   Nickels were hard to come by, especially in rural Arkansas. But the animals and the acres added up, and at his death in 1956, Miller left behind a respectable cattle operation of mostly white-faced Herefords.   Within two decades, that land lay idle and the cows were gone -- wiped out by an invisible enemy, a bacterial disease called brucellosis.   Even in the 1930\\'s, Miller would have known of brucellosis ; it\\'s plagued American cattle herds since the 1840\\'s and still costs U.S. cattle producers an estimated $30 million annually.

A possible strategy for achieving this goal could be to encourage dialogue between the educational and medical communities.   The steering committee asked organizations and schools to sign endorsements for the National Agenda Project. In small towns and large cities, in every state of the country, faculty meetings, parent support groups, boards of directors of multiservice organizations, local school districts, and state departments of education discussed the goals.

Vaccines containing acellular pertussis in the **35;2754;TOOLONG combination are expected to replace the conventional whole-cell vaccines ( DTP-w ). We tested the immunogenicity and safety of a combination of DTP-a with the Haemophilus influenzae type b ( Hib ) conjugate of Hib capsular polysaccharide and tetanus toxid ( PRP-T ), and inactivated poliovirus vaccine ( IPV ).   Methods 120 infants were enrolled and randomised to four groups to receive DTP-a at ages 2, 4, and 6 months. At 4 and 6 months they also received Hib conjugate and IPV, either as separate injections or mixed with DTP-a. All injections were given intramuscularly in the anterolateral area of the thigh. Any reactions after each vaccination were noted by the parents. EIA was used to measure titres of diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis antibodies, RIA for Hib anticapsular antibodies, and microneutralisation assay for poliovirus antibodies from serum samples collected at the ages of 2, 4, 6, and 7 months. [MASK_NOLOSS] Only mild adverse events were reported. There was a tendency towards slightly lower concentrations of filamentous haemagglutinin, tetanus, and poliovirus 1 antibodies when the vaccines were mixed. However, there was a more pronounced difference ( p=4x10 -8 ) in Hib antibodies between groups receiving Hib capsular polysaccharide mixed with DTP-a ( geometric mean concentrations 0.37 MUg/mL and 0.56 MUg/mL ) compared with groups receiving the vaccines separately ( 3.10 MUg/mL and 3.94 MUg/mL ).

Haemophilus influenzae type b ( Hib ) vaccines consisting of capsular polysaccharide protein conjugates have been introduced into routine vaccination programmes in several countries. Since authorities recommended that the first doses of both Hib conjugate and DTP-w vaccines are given at the same time ( between ages 2 and 6 months ) their suitability to be administered in combination has been tested. 1-11 The antibody concentrations after the primary series have in general been satisfactory, and the slightly lower concentrations of Hib or pertussis antibodies after mixing observed in some studies have been deemed clinically unimportant. Combinations of DTP-w with Hib, with or without IPV, have been licensed for general use in some European countries, the USA, and Canada.   New acellular pertussis vaccines have been developed to avoid the adverse events attributed to conventional whole-cell pertussis vaccines.

DTP-w vaccine is likely to be replaced in general vaccination programmes by DTP containing acellular pertussis vaccine ( DTP-a ).

This phenomenon has also been observed with another DTP-a and Hib oligosaccharide CRM197 protein conjugate. 24 A tendency towards lower concentrations of antibodies to the carrier protein ( tetanus toxoid 21, 23 or diphtheria toxin variants 24 ) was also seen in all of these studies.   The mechanism by which mixing of the vaccines reduced the antibody [MASK_NOLOSS]. Hib conjugates could be incompatible with the aluminium hydroxide adjuvant in the DTP-a vaccine. Theoretically a non-adsorbed component ( Hib conjugate ) might become adsorbed, or an adsorbed component ( diphtheria or tetanus toxoid ) become deadsorbed after mixing, and this change in presentation might offer their immunogenicity. The reports on mixtures of DTP-w and Hib conjugates did not, however, show any clear correlation between the type or amount of aluminum salts and impairment of Hib antibody responses.   The amount of specific Bordetella pertussis antigens is higher in the acellular than in whole-cell vaccines. 25 Components, such as filamentous haemagglutinin, might impair the immunogenicity of the Hib capsular polysaccharide vaccine. Why this impairment would occur only when the components are mixed is not clear.   Local antigenic competition or carrier-induced epitopic suppression are also possible mechanisms of interference between DTP-a ( containing tetanus toxoid ) and the Hib conjugate, in which the carrier protein is tetanus toxoid. However, this hypothesis should also be applicable to DTP-w mixed with Hib conjugates.   The clinical [MASK_NOLOSS] geometric mean concentration of Hib antibodies in Finnish studies after a similar primary immunisation series with commercially available PRP-T vaccine, given simultaneously with DTP-w but at a separate site, was 4-6 MUg/mL. 26, 27 This concentration is almost the same as that found in our study in the groups receiving the Hib and DTP-a vaccines separately, which supports the finding that interference only occurs when the vaccines are mixed. On the other hand, the much lower Hib capsular polysaccharide antibody concentrations in our DTP-a plus Hib combination groups ( C and D ) were similar to the Finnish efficacy trial with the first Hib conjugate ( PRP conjugated to diphtheria toxoid ). 28 That study showed 90% protective efficacy of the vaccine, which suggested',\n",
       " '[YEAR:1996]So what of thalassaemia? Unravelling evidence for the relation between thalassaemia and malaria has been painfully slow. The geographic correlates of thalassaemia and malaria, indicating protection against the infection, have been known for some time, 4 but the demonstrated [MASK_NOLOSS]. Parasites of Plasmodium falciparum invade and thrive normally in the hypochromic red cells of the thalassaemic individual. 5 The slightly longer persistence of fetal haemoglobin in newborn thalassaemic babies can not adequately explain significant protection even though this haemoglobin may in part account for a degree of protection in newborn babies in general. 6 Hence the finding that the amount of antibody per unit area of membrane bound by parasitised a and b thalassaemic red cells was greater in individuals from endemic areas than in controls, brought some relief. This observation provided a plausible explanation of protection if antibody-mediated opsonisation and consequent premature removal of infected cells is considered to be one of the major mechanisms of protection in malaria.   In the past few months the Oxford group working in Vanuatu reported the tantalising and stimulating finding that individuals with a-thalassaemia have an increased risk of uncomplicated clinical malaria, both falciparum and vivax. 8 How then could this \" protective \" gene be working to prevent death from malaria? The innovative proposal is that increased susceptibility of the relatively young cells found in [MASK_NOLOSS] vaccine hastening the acquisition of immunity. 9 A wildly speculative and as yet unproven explanation might be that although the relatively young cells of a-thalassaemic individuals are more susceptible to invasion, they are less likely to rosette, 10 and since rosetting has been one of the few parasite phenotypes associated with severe disease, the result of natural infection in the thalassaemic individual is tantamount to the receipt of a live attenuated vaccine. In this instance such attenuation is not the result of a parasite-determined modification, but because of a modified host factor. One of the many remaining pieces of the thalassaemic puzzle would be to demonstrate rapid acquisition of protective responses in thalassaemia. Alas, this is where we stumble, since even at the close of the 20th century there is still no clear in-vitro measure of protective immunity against malaria.

No significant differences between the groups in changes from baseline were observed in the safety laboratory tests ( data not shown ).   CD4 counts   No lymphocyte counts were available after baseline for five patients ( one MNrgp120, four placebo ) ; these participants were excluded from the primary efficacy analysis. Thus the analysis was based on 568 patients. CD4-cell count profiles were found to be roughly linear. There was no significant difference between the groups in the distribution of CD4 regression slopes for individual participants ( figure 2 ). The estimated mean rate of decline in CD4 count per year was 53.8 cells/MU L ( SE 7.6 ) in the MNrgp120 group and 42.3 cells/MU L ( 7.6 ) in the placebo group. The ratio of the estimated mean slopes was 1.27 ( 95% CI 0.63-2.55 ). The study was designed with power to detect a vaccine-induced 60% reduction in rate of decline in CD4 count. These results exclude with 95% confidence a reduction of 40% or more [MASK_NOLOSS] all lymphocytes and the mean profile plots of absolute CD4 counts and percentage CD4 counts ( figure 3 ) supported this interpretation.   In the subset analysis, 228 subjects were identified as having a high likelihood of progression based on baseline CD4 counts, CD4/CD8 ratios, plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration, and time since first positive HIV test. The vaccine recipients in this subset had a mean rate of decline in CD4 count per year of 85 cells/MU L ( SE 12.9 ) compared with 83 cells/MU L ( 13.1 ) in the placebo recipients. The ratio of mean rates of decline was 1.03 ( 95% CI 0.53-1.99 ). Similar rates of decline in CD4 count were observed with the matched San Francisco Men's Health Study cohort. 25   HIV-1 RNA concentrations   The median RNA concentration increased from 7640 copies/mL ( IQR 1800-24 080 ) at baseline to 9620 copies/mL ( 2320-36 080 ) for the 479 participants who had an RNA measurement at 15 months of\",\n",

In a previous placebo-controlled trial in symptom-free HIV-infected individuals with CD4 counts greater than 500 cells/MU L, MNrgp120 at doses of 300 MUg or 600 MUg was given monthly for 6 months and then 3 months later. 16, 17 Vaccination produced significant increases in lymphocyte proliferation to MNrgp120 antigen in vitro compared with placebo ( mean lymphocyte proliferation index 16.4 SE 4.7 and 12.0 4.6 for 600 MUg recipients at weeks 22 and [MASK_NOLOSS] recipients 16, 17 ). This vaccine has also demonstrated significant immunogenicity in HIV-seronegative individuals. 19 However, no significant effect of MNrgp120 vaccination on CD4 counts or percentages was observed in this study. The results exclude, with more than 95% certainty, that vaccine therapy would result in at least a 40% reduction in CD4 cell decline. Analysis in a subset of participants with rapid CD4 count loss gave similar results. For the full study population the relative risk of a 50% decline in CD4 counts from baseline was higher and this endpoint occurred sooner in vaccine recipients ; these findings approached but did not achieve statistical significance. Though the small number of endpoints makes these observations difficult to interpret, and possible explanations such as the appearance of enhancing antibodies are speculative, 26 further studies of therapeutic vaccination in HIV disease should include careful monitoring for rapid immunological decline in vaccine recipients.   Since there is dynamic HIV-1 turnover in most infected patients and since change in plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration with antiretroviral therapy predicts clinical benefit of treatment, [MASK_NOLOSS] our study is strong evidence that vaccination with MNrgp120 did not differ from placebo in effect on HIV replication. The immunological and virological results are supported by the observation that there was no difference in the number of HIV-related minor clinical events from baseline.

This condition is associated with increased blood levels of endogenous opioids in human beings and in animals, and treatment with opioid antagonists can relieve the pruritus. 14-17, 21 b-endorphin can be high in patients with chronic renal failure on dialysis, 22, 23 although the findings are equivocal. 19 We found normal levels of plasma endorphin in our patients, which were not different from those of dialysis patients without pruritus. We presume that naltrexone's beneficial effect on the pruritus of dialysis patients results from competition with endogenous opioids for opioid receptors. Attention has been focused on the role of opioid receptors in peripheral terminals of primary afferent neurons. 24   Our dialysis patients had high plasma histamine, as has been reported before. 4, 25 The relevance [MASK_NOLOSS] some investigators reporting a significant correlation 26 but others not. 1 Nevertheless, there is an agreement about the key role of histamine in the pathogenesis of pruritus, even though antihistamines are ineffective.

Opioids modulate nociception in inflamed tissues. 26 They probably modulate proliferation and function of immune cells in these tissues as well as mast-cell degranulation. 27   Mast cells occur in great number in the dermis of dialysis patients. Basophils, like mast cells, can release histamine when stimulated. Naloxone significantly prevented stimulated histamine-release from basophils in our experiments. By contrast, morphine did not do so.   The probable mechanism of naltrexone's action in relieving pruritus in our patients on dialysis is through inhibition of histamine release and not by an antiopioid effect.

The band-3 protein of allthe seven affected family members had slightlylower than normal electrophoretic mobility ( sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide gel ).

No DNA sequence changes in the band-3 genes were found in the kidney promoter for band-3 transcripts. 26 Arginine-589 lies in the cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane segments 6 and 7 of band 3, and is conserved in all known band-3 gene isoforms ( AE1, AE2, and AE3 ), which suggests that it is functionally important. This residue is next to lysine-590, which has a low pK and a role in anion transport. 27 These two aminoacids are located within a cluster [MASK_NOLOSS].   The overall 25% reduction in anion-transport activity ( compared with normal controls ) in individuals heterozygous for the dRTA mutation seems unlikely to account for the significant decrease in acid-secreting capacity in the renal tubular cells. Individuals with Southeast Asian ovalocytosis ( who are heterozygous for a completely inactive form of band 3 ) have less than 50% of normal red-cell anion-transport activity but are not known to have a defect in urinary acidification. The main effect of the dRTA mutation on tubular acid secretion seems likely to result from a different mechanism. For example, the mutation could lead to the formation of a membrane ion shunt, which would dissipate the ionic gradients required for the net movement of acid across the renal tubular cell. The unusual glycosylation of red-cell band 3 in both affected and unaffected members of this dRTA family suggests that there may be an additional alteration in some component that interacts with band 3.

A close inspection of colon cells by Beltsville colleague Padmanabhan Nair suggests that the bulk of these carotenoids may be providing protection within cells, rather than circulating in the plasma. He found huge increases ranging from 1,000 percent for lycopene to 4,000 percent for beta carotene.

Implementation   Serial links with performance similar to SSA have been available for some time. However, previous designs are often bulky, expensive, and power-hungry. Some use separate chips for the line driver and receiver, or the serializer and deserializer. Few are suitable for a small disk drive, where the hardware has to be compact, cheap, and consume little power. Ideally for this application, the interface should be capable of integration as part of a larger chip that includes other functions such as the disk formatter.   Currently an entire dual-port SSA node has been implemented in a single serial interface chip ( SIC ). The SIC connects directly to the interface cable and includes the SSA protocol, the router, the frame buffers, and 24 DMA channels. It has a flexible back-end interface which can support adapter, controller, switch, and disk-drive applications. However, the following sections describe only the high-speed circuits which deal with the serial data [MASK_NOLOSS] it is fabricated using a 0.45-mum ( effective ) technology having three layers of metal. This is a standard CMOS logic process with no enhancements, to enable the designer to use analog components such as resistors and bipolar devices. The choice of process was based more on the requirements of the logic than those of the analog circuits.   The SIC was designed as a set of macros using a standard-cell methodology. This means that in future the SSA node could become part of a larger chip that includes other functions. The following macros are associated with the serial data : Deserializer. Serializer. Phase detector. Voltage-controlled oscillator ( VCO ) and charge pump. Bias current generator. Line driver. Line receiver.   The first three are logic macros. Owing to the 200-MHz clock rate and critical timing, the logic gates and interconnections are fixed within each macro. However, the macros themselves can be moved around the chip. The last four macros are analog circuits which are located in the input/output ( I/O ) [MASK_NOLOSS] the macros use the same 3.3-V power supply as the logic, although some are fed via separate pins',\n",
       " '[YEAR:1996] results   Figure 12 shows the compress-to ratios of IBMLZ1 variants. The IBM-1K and 1BM-2K variants result from the use of 1K and 2K history buffers, respectively. The IBM-1KF and IBM-2KF are the results from fast-attack 28 versions that aimed at improving the initial coding efficiency when the history buffer is partially filled. The block size denotes the size limit at which the compression is restarted. The blocking effect appears on the channel to the storage controller, where 4K is the most typical block size and the next most common block size is 2K. The CAM of a 1K history buffer is about 60K equivalent-cell area, suggesting that a 1K CAM instead of 2K will yield good compression while minimizing circuit size. IBMLZ1 compression technology for storage controllers   A family of compression chips based on the IBMLZ1 compression algorithm has been developed. An 0.8-mum 75 000-gate array achieved 40MB/s throughput 31 ; a 0.5-mum version is expected to reach 50MB/s throughput. Figure 13 depicts a comprehensive compression subsystem chip with the compression macro imbedded [MASK_NOLOSS] between the ESCON and the cache unit for the array storage controller. As mentioned earlier, pipelined operation yields the maximal system benefit.   Log-structured storage management provides efficient integration of compression for the storage controller. In CKD ( count key data ) environments, individual blocks of data are frequently updated. Since the compression effect is data-dependent, the newly compressed data can not be guaranteed to fit in the space left by the old data. The log-structured technique for dealing with this unpredictability is not to attempt updates in place, but rather to collect changed data in a log and write the data to DASD in free space, maintaining a directory which maps the logical address of the data to the actual physical location. The directory can then be reviewed periodically to find sparsely populated areas on disk and collect the space for reuse.

The eight narrow rectangles at the bottom are the I/O cells containing the input and output buffers ; the circles and the associated wire paths represent the bumps and the top-layer metal connecting the bumps to eight I/O cells.

Figure 3 illustrates features of the die template for a small die, showing how the 0.46-mm-wide pattern cell of Figure 2 is repeated across all edges of the die, with unique pattern cells in the corner.   The base footprint is found on the smallest die ( 3.5 mm ). Each successive die image template is generated by adding two more pattern cells to each edge of the previous die size, generating a series of die templates in 0.92-mm increments. This modular approach allows for expedient design of both die templates and packages.   The design approach described above facilitates the reuse of packages across technologies while allowing customers to maintain plug compatibility. Gate-array/standard-cell intermix   The CMOS 5 generation of ASICs makes use of the gate-array/standard-cell intermix methodology introduced by IBM in 1987 7. The layouts of standard-cell elements are customized on both the diffused layers and the metallization layers. Figure 4 depicts the layout of the AND3 standard cell, with the unshaded diffusion and polysilicon layers forming the transistors, and the shaded metallization [MASK_NOLOSS] interconnecting the transistors.   Gate-array elements are customized only on the metallization layers. Figure 5 depicts the layout of the AND3 gate-array ceil. The transistors formed by the diffusion and polysilicon layers are the standard template for all gate-array cells. Only the metallization layers interconnecting the transistors are unique for this function. The availability of local interconnect allows this cell to leave many metal-1 tracks open for global routing 8.   The identical boundary conditions and power bus location of the cells in Figures 4 and 5 allow them to be placed side by side. The all-level customization of the standard cells generally makes them denser and faster than their gate-array counterparts, and therefore desirable for use in critical paths of a chip design.

If a design change to the logic is required after the initial hardware has been built, additional gates can be implemented in these unused transistors with only metal mask changes, as shown in Figure 7.   Gate-array I/O functions are included in the library to allow quick cycle time changes to the I/Os as well. This feature allows customers whose external application conditions have changed to accommodate these changes with metal-only changes to the design. The impedance matching and slew rate of the drivers can be altered in this scheme to match changes in the application's off-chip net configurations. Library deliverables   Access to the library is obtained by the delivery of a design kit from the ASIC supplier to the customer. This design kit includes documentation and models to support selected design methodologies. Software tools have been written for the automatic generation of both documentation and models to speed up development of the design kit for a new technology.   The documentation process has [MASK_NOLOSS] product databook contains detailed information about the complete ASIC offering, including timing information and functional descriptions of each library element. Timing information is automatically extracted from the timing model and inserted into a databook template. Because library element names, pin names, and library element functionaire consistent across technologies, very little manual editing of the databook is required between technologies.   The same approach was taken for model generation. Synthesis, simulation, test, and physical design models can all be quickly generated using databases that change little from technology to technology. The information that does change between technologies, such as timing information, is extracted from the timing model and inserted into the other model types. This approach has also\",\n",

To support the reduced-pin-count test methodology, each driver function is implemented as bidirectional I/O for use in I/O cells not contacted during test.

The 2.5-V I/Os may be used on either the single-supply 2.5-V chips or the dual-supply chips. The 3.3-V I/Os may be used only on dual-supply 2.5-V/3.3-V chips.   The I/O library for CMOS 6S, also a 2.5-V technology, will include the same variety of 2.5-V and 3.3-V drivers as CMOS 5X, with the same package options. Library design point   The key objective in defining the internal library design point is to quickly create designs which are both easily migratable and easily used, without sacrificing performance or density. This is accomplished through the choice of electrical and physical design characteristics.   Internal library designs must work well over a range of technologies with different supply voltages and device characteristics, particularly ratios of p-MOS to n-MOS device current. As a result, designs are analyzed not only for the technology in which they are designed, but also for those to which they are expected to [MASK_NOLOSS] best compromise between technologies, and designs that are highly ratio-dependent are generally avoided. Clock circuits are designed to minimize differences between rising and falling delay and transition rates. Critical cells are redesigned for specific technologies where required.   Physical design choices have been made to avoid unnecessary complexity without affecting density or wirability. Simple, symmetric cell boundary conditions reduce the incidence of chip-level cell-to-cell conflicts and allow cells to be mirrored to reduce wire lengths.

With the local interconnect level available for intracell routing, only a minimum set of metal-1 tracks is reserved for use by the cell design. Additional tracks are used in preferential order when required, typically leaving six metal-I tracks free for global routing. All pins are metal-2-accessible, but in many cases nets between adjacently placed cells can be wired on metal-1. The metal usage standards allow the creation of simple place-and-route models. Collectively, all [MASK_NOLOSS].   The I/O library design point is chosen to optimally support the multiple interface types required by the customer. However, I/O circuits do not migrate well because of limitations imposed by technology reliability and supply voltage issues. The objective is therefore to define families of circuit types which can be migrated across technologies with the least amount of redesign. For example, 3.3-V I/Os in a 3.3-V technology become the basis for 2.5-V designs in a 2.5-V technology. This is aided by the use of implanted resistors to control driver output impedance and slew rates, rather than environment sensing or feedback-based schemes which can require extensive circuit optimization. Logical behavior is preserved across technologies to simplify the migration of customer designs. Library characterization and qualification   Qualification of an ASIC design system is much different from the qualification of a custom chip. For ASIC chips, each unique customer design is not individually characterized. Instead, delivery of a quality ASIC design system requires verification and qualification of all of the individual elements that may be used in that [MASK_NOLOSS] with the other elements to produce a design which will meet customer specifications. To achieve this goal, the following characterization and verification activities are required for each element of the library : Functionality verification. Timing verification.

Since Synopsys currently has no way to account for the degradation of rising and falling transitions due to the effects of RC, any high-fan-out nets will cause timing problems to be seen in EinsTimer that were not seen by Design Compiler. This can be minimized by limiting fan-out to less than fifteen. Testing has shown that once RC [MASK_NOLOSS] EinsTimer and Synopsys will be close to 100% for worst-case assumptions. Floorplanning   Wire delay for deep-submicron designs can be the predominant part of total path delay. For this delay, a significant advantage can be achieved with floorplanning, which provides for early placement of logical functions, macros, and inputs/outputs ( I/Os ) on the chip to meet various goals.   Floorplanning increases in importance with greater chip densities and higher performance requirements, and generally becomes a necessary step in the design process for chips with more than one million gates.   Without floorplanning, the prediction of parasitics is based solely upon technology-level data or area-based wire-load models, resulting in significant differences from the actual net parasitics found in the physical design. This limits the ability of logic synthesis to optimize for performance because the synthesis tool is unable to determine path delays accurately.   A logic design environment in which logic synthesis and floorplanning are closely linked is key to shortening design cycles and meeting performance objectives 6. For one-million-cell designs, a typical iteration through [MASK_NOLOSS] week is typical. This is far less than the traditional iteration through physical design ( placement and wire routing ).   The advantages gained by customers using floorplanning 19-21 on their designs include the following : The effects of a suboptimal I/O assignment are easily seen, giving the customer an earlier opportunity for correction. The customer can optimize earlier in the design cycle for die size and metal layers. The customer can identify and insert all repowering buffers necessitated by high-fan-out nets. Timing closure using accurate parasitics occurs earlier in the design cycle and in the customer's hands, where design changes are less costly. The pre-layout static timing analysis sign-off is based upon more accurate parasitics. Time in physical design is shorter because of a more predictable design and more accurate pre-layout timing sign-off.

The following is a list of the prefix types and their functions : PREFORMATTED TABLE   These pseudo-cells are mapped into LSSD SRLs as depicted in Figure 4 and described below.   The methodology that maps from D and DF pseudo-cells, using either the Synopsys Test Compiler or IBM BooleDozer, scans the netlist for these cells and replaces them with their target cells ( either a true D-mimic SRL in the case of the D cell, or an F pseudo-cell in the case of a DF ).

In contrast, the subsequent mapping of the F cell creates a master-slave LSSD SRL, plus a clock splitter that can be shared among several SRLs, thus reducing the chip area overhead of LSSD.

Flattening of the netlist can be done either by the customer or by an IBM design center. Customers designing in the IBM CMOS 5 technologies can use either a hierarchical or a flat physical design process, using the IBM ChipBenchTM 11 layout tool.

This system of congregate labor had the great advantage of making Auburn inexpensive to operate, and the prison became the prototype for institutions across the country.   The Pennsylvania system established in Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia was more expensive to operate but had loftier goals. The Quakers who ran the prison believed that convicts had a tendency to corrupt one another and that solitary confinement with the Bible ( the only book allowed ) would serve a rehabilitative purpose.

       " \"[YEAR:1997]This article begins with reviews of parallel processing models in the areas of visual perception and memory, pointing out kinds of information purported to be processed in each, and the overlap in the physiological substrates involved. Next, some pertinent literature having to do with the linkage between perception and memory is reviewed ( e.g., visual memory for what or where ), concluding that there exists a serious lack of research and knowledge of how different perceptual processes may lead to facilitated, distorted or impaired memory in different forms of storage. Some possible scenarios are presented concerning how perceptual information might be interfaced with memorial mechanisms, and some working hypotheses are considered. Finally, a new paradigm is outlined that examines the linkage between local and global perceptual processing and explicit and implicit learning. This paradigm combines the global precedence paradigm of Navon ( 1977 ; 1981 ) and the sequence learning paradigm of Nissen and Bullemer ( 1987 ). Convincing arguments indicate that global stimuli are mediated more quickly via one perceptual stream ( the M-cell pathway ), but can be processed more slowly by another [MASK_NOLOSS] stimuli are exclusively mediated by the P-cell system.

Spatial filtering of the visual stimuli reveals that low spatial frequencies are necessary for sequence learning to occur. The issue of whether this learning is implicit or explicit is also discussed. Ideas for future research, exploring this new area of interest, are proposed.

Differences for processing of global and local information have also been demonstrated by patients with brain damage who are asked to make reaction time responses to hierarchical stimuli, which are stimuli made up of small items arranged in a particular spatial array to form a recognizable larger item. The principle of global precedence will be discussed further in a later section of this article. Neuropsychological tests involving this paradigm have revealed that lesions of the left [MASK_NOLOSS] aspects of an item, where right-hemisphere lesions disrupt the ability to perceive global but not local aspects of a stimulus ( Dells, Robertson, and Efron, 1986 ). These lesions are usually found in the temporal region, part of the ventral visual-processing system, which is consistent with the idea that this area is specialized for object recognition ( Robertson, Lamb and Knight, 1988 ).   These findings show strong parallels between the areas of visual processing and memory. The finding that damage to cortical areas surrounding the amygdala disrupts object discrimination relates well to the fact that it is this area that receives projections from the parvo pathway. The disruption of tasks requiring memory for spatial position and temporal order seen with dorsal stream damage is commensurate with M-cell input of such information to that region. LINKING PROPOSITIONS   Early notions of the transfer of information from perceptual stages to memory involved the concept of a short-term sensory storage ( STSS -Sperling, 1960 ) stage wherein \" visual or auditory snap shots \" were held for brief [MASK_NOLOSS] while, attended aspects of the scene were transferred to a short-term memory stage ( STM - Peterson and Peterson, 1959 ), where it was estimated to be accessible for less than 1 min. when active rehearsal was prevented.

The properties of STSS were originally investigated with stimuli that could be processed as verbal material ( Sperling, 1960 ), but a later series of studies on visual persistence employed nonlinguistic measures ( Meyer and Maguire, 1977 ; May, Brown Scott and Donlon, 1990 ). These studies found that the duration of persistence was determined by the spatial frequency content of visual stimuli.   Investigations of STM have used, almost exclusively, verbal material, and little attention has been given to the spatial frequency content of stimuli presented visually. Consolidation and long-term storage of information in STM is thought to be facilitated by rehearsal, and chunking of items as they are transferred into long-term memory ( LTM ) stores. This conceptualization of the perceptual-memorial linkage had appeal because of its generality, but the lack of [MASK_NOLOSS] types of visual information are transferred, and descriptions of the various forms of LTM reviewed above are based on cognitive models, as opposed to visual models of memory content.   Mishkin and co-workers ( for review see, Mishkin and Appenzeller, 1987 ) have made the greatest contribution to our understanding of how perceptually defined aspects of a situation are stored in memory. They propose two memory systems in the primate brain concerned with encoding objects ( the what ) and their spatial position ( the where ). The perception of these two stimulus attributes appear to depend on the integrity of inferior temporal and the parietal cortex, respectively. With well-designed behavioral experiments they have determined which areas of the \" what \" pathway serve perceptual processing ( object discrimination ) and which areas support the memory for objects ( object recognition ). This is an important distinction for the definitions of perception and memory. Object discrimination involves immediate differentiation of object properties, while object recognition denotes storage and retrieval of associations between objects.

The consistency effect, however, did not follow the same time course which, they argue, suggests that the consistency [MASK_NOLOSS] The global precedence paradigm offers some advantages in addressing the linkage between perception and memory. Discriminating between the global figures depends on the ability to detect differences in where local elements are located, but is unaided by the identity of these elements. Discrimination of the local elements depends on detecting differences in the form of these elements, and is unaided by the redundancy of elements in many locations. If subjects do perform these two tasks with different pathways, then it may be the case that incidental learning about the sequence of \" what \" ( local elements ) or \" where \" ( global figures ) may be inferred from performance over repeated trials.   The removal of low spatial frequencies through spatial filtering has been found to slow RTs to global aspects of visual stimuli presumably by forcing these aspects to be processed through the slower, high frequency sensitive, p-cell pathways ( Badcock et al., 1990 ). To address the question of whether or not sequence learning is mediated by the m-cell pathway, the present experiment combined [MASK_NOLOSS] with that of Badcock, Whitworth, Badcock and Lovegrove ( 1990 ). Choice RTs, for the global or local aspects of a sequence of compound stimuli that were filtered to remove low spatial frequencies and nonfiltered stimuli that were matched in contrast, were obtained. Learning was possible ( iterative sequence ) in all conditions, and the sequence used was the same for all groups. After all trials were completed subjects were asked to replicate the pattern in the sequence of stimuli, which provided an index of explicit memory. If sequence learning occurs in both \" what \" and \" where \" pathways, RT differences would be expected for both the local and global conditions. If sequence learning occurs both implicitly and explicitly, both RT and verbal report measures should reveal knowledge of the sequence. If sequence learning is confined to the \" what \" pathway, RT differences would be expected for both local and global conditions, but if sequence learning is confined to the \" where \" pathway, RT differences would be expected only [MASK_NOLOSS] Forty university students and members of the community served as subjects. Twentyfour were female and sixteen were male. All were naive as to the hypothesis under investigation. Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 40.

       " '[YEAR:1997]normalized RT occurred between the unfiltered local and global conditions indicates that this paradigm involved differential processing of local discriminations by the \" what \" pathway and global discriminations by the \" where \" pathway. Under these conditions sequence learning [MASK_NOLOSS] where \" pathway was employed. Spatial filtering of the stimuli, a manipulation designed to force subjects to employ the \" what \" pathway, disrupted sequence learning when subjects performed the global task. It is unlikely that this sequence learning derived from motor learning in that the stimulus manipulation disrupted learning only for the global conditions.   The crosslag correlation scores indicated that only 5 of the 40 subjects exhibited strong explicit learning ( r = 1.00 ) : 2 in each of the unfiltered groups and 1 in the global filtered condition. Thus, the use of a more complex task reduced explicit learning compared to Experiment 1. This finding is consistent with the suggestion that sequence learning in the present study occurred implicitly first, but a few subjects attained enough conscious awareness of the sequence to remember it explicitly. The suggestion that sequence learning is implicit, at first, is also consistent with the findings of Willingham, Nissen and Bullemer ( 1989 ), that sequence learning was apparent from RT measures after 100 trials, but subjects [MASK_NOLOSS] had responded to over 300 trials. However, the finding could also support the idea of parallel, interactive functions of implicit and explicit memory ( Reber, Allen and Regan, 1985 ; Berry and Broadbent, 1988 ) in that the task was learned largely implicitly, though the nonimplicit process of recognizing the sequence may occur and assist in learning. The findings that a significant correlation between implicit learning ( RT differences between trial blocks 23 and 24 ) and explicit learning scores ( crosslag correlations ) was not obtained, and that explicit measures of learning were correlated with intelligence, but implicit measures were not, further support the idea of parallel, interactive functions of implicit and explicit memory. The significant correlation between intelligence and explicit memory scores suggests that it was the subjects with higher IQ scores that learned explicitly. Thus, it is perhaps one\\'s level of cognitive ability that mediates the interaction of explicit processes with implicit processes.   This research has resulted in evidence that the manipulations which curtail m-cell inputs to the \" [MASK_NOLOSS] in both the significant evidence of sequence learning for the global aspects of the stimuli and the significant lack of learning for the global task with low spatially filtered stimuli.

Explicit learning scores correlate with I.Q., and this implies that perhaps there is an interaction of implicit and explicit memory that is mediated by one\\'s cognitive ability. GENERAL DISCUSSION   The major finding of this article is that, under some conditions, a stimulus manipulation intended to bias which perceptual processes are used to perform a task can determine whether incidental learning occurs. This provides data in support of the notion that certain kinds of learning, in this case sequence learning, require certain stimulus inputs for optimal processing. The data also suggest that the sequence learning occurred implicitly, and this supports the notion that learning in the \" where \" pathway occurs implicitly. Explicit learning of sequence is clearly possible, as evidenced in [MASK_NOLOSS] demands are high. The strategy employed in this experimental effort parallels the strategies that were pioneered by visual psychophysicists in their attempt to discern the functional roles of the p- and m-cell pathways.   Future extensions of this approach might benefit from numerous other stimulus manipulations that have been shown to favor processing in the \" what \" pathway. Since m-cells require abrupt onsets or offsets for vigorous activation, ramping stimuli gradually on and off should stimulate m-cells poorly, but should provide considerable stimulation for p-cells. Livingston and Hubel ( 1987 ; 1988 ), suggested that another way to \" silence \" m-cell activity is to present stimuli in isoluminance, since m-cells do not respond to purely chromatic differences. Another manipulation related to color differences in these cells concerns the fact that a subpopulation of m-cells is tonically suppressed by red light ( Wiesel and Hubel 1966 ; DeMonasterio and Schein 1980 ; and Dreher, Fukada, and Rodieck 1975 ). Psychophysical experiments comparing performance with different colored surrounds have successfully disrupted the m-cell response ( Breitmeyer, May [MASK_NOLOSS] has to do with whole field flick',\n",

Psychophysical experiments comparing performance with different colored surrounds have successfully disrupted the m-cell response ( Breitmeyer, May [MASK_NOLOSS] has to do with whole field flicker. Since m-cells respond vigorously to rapid luminance modulation, some researchers have used such stimulation to \" jam \" m-cell processing while subjects perform RT tasks ( Lovegrove, Lehmkuhle, Baro, and Garzia, 1990 ). The use of such stimulus manipulations in learning and memory paradigms may well shed further light on the contributions of the perceptual streams to different memory systems.   Another line of evidence that could yield converging support for the notion that different perceptual pathways feed into different memorial systems could come from the study of memory in special populations with perceptual disabilities. Brannan and Williams ( 1987 ) found that children with reading disabilities were not able to utilize information provided by a cue to target location in a target detection task if the cue preceded the target by less than 50 msec., whereas normal readers could utilize such information at shorter temporal separations. Likewise, it has been shown that children with reading disabilities require more time than either normal reading children or adults to make accurate judgments [MASK_NOLOSS] presented first ( Brannan and Williams, 1987 ; May, Williams, and Dunlap, 1988 ). Given that the m-cell stream is a likely candidate for the mediation of temporal order, these results suggest that disabled readers may have a slow or sluggish \" where \" pathway. In two studies, Solman and May ( 1990 ) compared the size of spatial discrepancies, in locating letter and nonletter stimuli in space, by good and poor readers. In the first experiment, spatial discrepancies increased with eccentricity for both groups, but the rate of increase was significantly greater for the poor readers. The second study required that two spatially and temporally located targets be localized on each trial. Results similar to Experiment 1 were obtained. In both experiments the children were also asked to report what letter had been presented on the trials involving letters. The groups did not differ with regard to identification',\n",

Of the 151 eligible children, 135 were available for confirmatory tests on serum samples collected by venepuncture. 130 children were seropositive by the three tests on these samples. The criteria for a child to be classified as seropositive and included in the trial were a reciprocal titre on indirect immunofluorescence of 40 or more, an ELISA index of 1.2 or more, and a reciprocal titre on indirect haemagglutination of 16 or more.

The middle envelope protein [MASK_NOLOSS] this residue is glycosylated with an oligosaccharide, which is, in part, mannose-terminated. 15 Therefore, opsonisation of viral particles by normal serum MBP is possible. The higher frequency of the codon 52 mutation among patients with chronic HBV infection than among controls is consistent with the possibility that the mutation impairs opsonisation and phagocytosis of HBV, as occurs with yeast. 16 However, the absence of an association between persistent HBV infection and the mutant alleles of codons 54 and 57, which result in very low serum concentrations of MBP, 10, 11 suggests that any reduction in the serum concentration of MBP in patients with the codon 52 allele is insufficient to explain the disease association. The codon 52 mutation ( a cysteine for arginine substitution ) differs from the other two mutations ( in which axial glycines are replaced by dicarboxylic acids ). We and others 11, 12 have found that this mutation has a lesser effect on MBP concentrations than other mutations, but it is associated with bacterial infections. 13, 14 It is possible that [MASK_NOLOSS] an opsonin. The codon 52 variant MBP may bind to HBV and fail to facilitate uptake by phagocytic cells, but may increase uptake by hepatocytes thereby increasing the infective load in the liver. An alternative explanation for this association is that the codon 52 mutation in the MBP gene is linked to mutations in another unidentified gene in linkage disequilibrium with the MBP locus, which influences the host response to HBV.   In Caucasian patients with persistent HBV infection, among whom the highest frequency of the codon 52 allele was seen, HBV infection is usually acquired in adult life due to sexual contact or exposure to blood during intravenous drug use. The infecting innoculum is small, and therefore defects in opsonic function may be critical in influencing outcome. Although the small sample size does not exclude a small contribution of codon 52 mutations to persistent HBV infection in Asian patients, it does make unlikely a contribution of the magnitude seen in the Caucasian patients. The lower frequency of the codon 52 mutant allele in Asian patients with chronic [MASK_NOLOSS] virus is acquired. In Asia, infection usually occurs at birth, and the infecting innoculum may be larger ; in this setting most individuals become persistently infected as a result of the induction of T-cell tolerance by secreted HBe, which crosses the placenta. 20 Thus, genetic factors will be less important, and may not be detectable in this small sample.

It is critical to overlays and repair mortar application, since corrosion inhibitors are not substitutes for good quality concrete.   Number 3 is the most complicated to prove, although quite a bit of work has now been completed. For many specifiers, it is important that the physical transport mechanisms that allow the inhibitor to penetrate the concrete are clearly understood and documented.

By drilling holes and collecting dust samples, inhibitor amounts can be detected at various depths. Figures 9 a, b and c show the results of this penetration testing. This test was conducted on applications of inhibitors in horizontal, vertical and overhead orientations, with virtually the same results.   Those skeptical of laboratory testing will be glad to know that these results can now be verified through onsite testing. Cores are taken at a specified depth, most often the depth of the steel.

A condition survey is necessary to identify the root caused and extent of the corrosion damage. What is the client trying to achieve? Is a long-term solution or a quick-fix needed?

Conclusion   Research and testing have produced results that clearly verify the beneficial effects of corrosion inhibitors. Corrosion inhibitors are no longer the \" new kids on the block \" in the concrete industry. Thousands of cubic yards of new concrete containing corrosion inhibiting admixtures are being placed each year. The advantages and limitations of different inhibitor formulations ( with respect to concrete ) are now better understood. For this reason, inhibitors are finding their \" fit \" ( not as a panacea for all corrosion problems, but as a way to buy time and extend the life of structures ).   The challenge for the future is quantification. This means better quantifying the benefits and better defining how much \" bang for the buck \" the client is receiving.

The 1s in each matrix row represent the bits of the input vector for which parity must be computed in order to get the 32-bit vector ( indexed 0 to 31 ) that is the result of the division by G * ( x ). The column labeled \" XOR inputs \" in Table 2 indicates how many [MASK_NOLOSS] bit of the corresponding row. A 13-input XOR is required. The speed of such an array can by no means match the cycle time of the state machine previously described ; the equivalent of several cycles is necessary to generate the result. Taking into consideration, however, that this calculation is done only once at the end, one realizes that the overall computation is much faster than with traditional methods, even if short messages ( down to single-cell messages ) are considered. Method summary   The whole computation scheme is summarized hereafter for M 123. As an example, let us assume that the message is one kilobyte long. The state machine cycle time to process one byte can be as low as 10 ns ( a 100-MHz state machine ) with a two-input XOR. Thus, the 48 bytes of each ATM cell are calculated ID 480 ns ( one cell every 700 ns at 622 megabits per second ). The complete message, which comprises 21 cells, requires roughly 10, us plus the final division [MASK_NOLOSS] ( i.e., 50 ns maximum ). Thus, the final division accounts for only 0.5% of the total calculation time in this first example. For a single-cell message ( the worst case ), which is processed in 480 ns, the final division accounts for approximately 10% of the total computation time. The',\n",

The two-step scheme described in this paper is summarized in Figure 2 for M 123.   The three polynomials given in Table I are the best that the author was able to find in an exhaustive search up to degree 128 of multiples of G(x). ( Only those multiples with consecutive terms having exponents differing by 8 or more were retained. Polynomials M 71 and M 53 are actually by-products of this search, which was conducted only to find the polynomial of lowest possible degree that permits the first division to be performed per 8-bit byte while requiring only two-input XORs. M 123 is the result of this search. ) The use of a two-input operator guarantees that the state machine is intrinsically the fastest possible. [MASK_NOLOSS] come only from a polynomial of degree less than 123, with fewer terms, which would require less hardware but provide no speed advantage. Summary and conclusion   This paper describes a method of computing the AAL5 ATM CRC-32 at very high speed. The division is first carried out with a polynomial M(x) different from the one chosen by the standards, so as to ease the calculation while cells are being received or transmitted. When the last cell is processed, a final ( slower ) single division by the CRC-32 polynomial G * ( x ) must be performed to finish the calculation. This scheme, which is possible because M(x) is a simple multiple of G * ( x ), permits performing most of the calculation with a very fast state machine that is able to match the very high throughput needed to handle AAL5 connections transported on optical lines, like OC-12 ( 622 megabits per second ), for which one ATM cell must be processed every 700 ns. The new scheme still allows the use of standard [MASK_NOLOSS] be necessary to make the calculation with traditional methods by means of the polynomial G * ( x )',\n",

Even some people who participated in genetics research have subsequently lost their health insurance, including a man who underwent screening for a type of colon cancer as part of a study at the Huntsman Cancer Center at the University of Utah.   Basing Insurance on Genetics   These actions do follow a certain calculated logic. Since it is accepted policy for health insurers to exclude [MASK_NOLOSS] loophole for classifying numerous diseases or other medical conditions as pre-existing because they have their roots in the genes of prospective insureds.   At first glance, such a policy might seem reasonable, akin to charging smokers higher rates. After all, insurance is based on the concepts of risk-spreading and risk-sharing. When most people\\'s future health risks are unknown, the future health care costs of a group can be predicted on an aggregate, actuarial basis and the costs spread across the whole group.   But with genetics technology beginning to identify which people in a group are likely to develop particular diseases later on, insurance companies have begun to target them for special treatment : higher rates or denial of coverage.   Carried to its extreme, that approach to coverage could make everyone uninsurable, since every human being carries between eight and 12 \" defective \" genes that might trigger various medical disorders.

In the future, schoolchildren might be screened to identify genes for dyslexia or other learning difficulties, then receive special assistance to compensate for the genetic flaw.   The problem with such an approach, however, is that even if such genes can be identified ( and this is a big \" if, \" given that reputable researchers from respected institutions such as Yale have in recent years claimed to have found genes for complex behaviors only to later have to retract their findings ), carrying a gene and manifesting the disorder are two different matters.

The motors situated at different characteristic frequency points on the cochlear partition, each responsible for the amplification of a certain frequency component contained in a complex sound stimulus, seem to function simultaneously and independently of one another. ( n32 ) This is implied by recordings of auditory nerve activity ( n33 ) and basilar membrane motion ( n34 ) in response to broad-band sound stimuli. Therefore, the force produced by an OHC in vivo must follow the stimulus cycle-by-cycle if it is to be responsible for cochlear tuning. Whether this is indeed the case has never been shown directly in vivo. However, in temporal bone preparations, vibration measurements of the tectorial membrane and basilar membrane in response to intracochlear current injection suggest that the OHC is capable of cycle-by-cycle [MASK_NOLOSS] Motor is Limited by the Membrane Time Constant   Perhaps the greatest limitation for the motor response of the OHC is the time constant of its basolateral cell membrane. It is dependent on the number and type of ion channels in the plasma membrane and determines the speed at which the charge across the cell membrane changes. ( n31, n37, n38 ) The time constant, which is characteristic for each cell, causes the receptor potential -- the driving stimulus for the motor -- to be attenuated and phase-shifted relative to the displacement of the stereocilia ( Figure 1 ). Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from isolated OHCs have shown that the electrical properties of the cell membrane resemble those of a first-order low-pass filter. ( n37-n39 ) This filter determines the frequency response of the receptor potential : ( n37 ) 1 ) the amplitude of the receptor potential is constant up to a corner frequency, above which it decreases at 6 dB/oct ( Figure 2A ) ; and 2 ) the phase difference between receptor potential and hair-bundle displacement is zero at low frequencies [MASK_NOLOSS] tends to reach -90 degrees at higher frequencies ( Figure 2B ). The corner frequency of the membrane filter decreases monotonically with increasing cell length which, when plotted on a logarithmic frequency axis, amounts to a decrease of 0.58 oct per 10 Mum increase of cell length, beginning at 546 Hz for the shortest recorded cell length of 20 Mum.

Therefore, disruption of cochlear motor function causes not only loss of hearing threshold and narrowing of dynamic range, but also loss of frequency selectivity and speech discrimination. Pathological Conditions Causing Disruption of Cochlear Motor Function   Normal function of the cochlear motor is not only dependent on intact OHCs but, as described previously, is also dependent on the highly sensitive interplay of the OHCs with surrounding [MASK_NOLOSS] OHCs as the main cause of hearing loss with recruitment has been established in animal models by producing controlled cochlear damage which, in humans, is known to cause hearing loss with loss of speech discrimination ( i.e., hearing loss after sound overexposure, intoxication with aminoglycosides ( n62 ) or presbycusis ( n65 ) ). Since OHC damage as the underlying cause of malfunction of cochlear motor function has been well reviewed in the past, ( n66-68 ) the following paragraphs will be restricted to a discussion of pathological conditions, other than hair cell damage, that may cause cochlear motor dysfunction.   First, the function of otherwise healthy OHCs can be impaired by reduction of the endolymphatic potential. The richly vascularized strict vascularis supplies the endolymph with a high K+ concentration ( 150 mM ) and a positive potential of 80 mV. ( n69-71 ) The endolymphatic potential, together with the resting membrane potential, provide the battery for mechanoelectrical transduction in the hair-cell stereocilia ( n72, n73 ) and, therefore, also for the motor function [MASK_NOLOSS] motion. Indeed, in animal experiments, systemic injection of the loop diuretic furosemide, which is known to reduce the endocochlear potential, ( n74, n75 ) caused a reversible reduction of the tuned response amplitudes of the basilar membrane. ( n34 ) Disruption of the cochlear blood supply rapidly and reversibly reduces the endolymphatic potential -- up to 70 mV after a five-minute occlusion of the vein of the cochlear aqueduct. ( n76 ) It is feasible that an unstable or oscillatory endolymphatic potential may be an underlying cause of fluctuant hearing loss and even certain types of tinnitus.   Second, disruption of the integrity of the tectorial membrane might also provide a model for various types of hearing disorders, ( n77-n79 ) since the shape and structure of the tectorial membrane are particularly sensitive',\n",

AEA's CFX CFD software uses finite volumes ( instead of finite elements ) and provides RNG K-epsilon and Reynolds Stress turbulence models that Transcend engineers have found to be more accurate than other models they have evaluated in valve flow problems. Good turbulence models are key to accurately predicting the location of flow separation and the pressure loss across the valve.   This software also provides a powerful higher order convection'scheme called CCCT. This convection scheme substantially reduces the number of cells required to solve a problem of this type. The computation time needed to arrive at a fully converged solution is approximately five times faster than with most other codes that only offer single order convection schemes. In addition, the unique multi-block grid structure of CFX improves accuracy by avoiding the need for skewed element shapes. Modelling   A CFD model of the original DRV-B design was created to serve as a validation case for the modeling setup. Taking advantage of its axisymmetry, the valve was modeled in two [MASK_NOLOSS] of 2.5 m/s. The 60,000-cell model took about 10 hours to converge on a HP workstation with 128 Megabytes of RAM :.   Flow separation could be seen in the velocity vector plots as regions of low and negative flow rates relative to the inlet velocity. The analysis also showed secondary factors contributing to the pressure loss across the valve including high peak velocity at the seat angle and the unequal and irregular velocity distribution and deceleration in the top and bottom diffusers. The results showed that the primary reasons for flow separation were poor flow conditions at the diffuser inlet and rapidly expanding cross sections in a straight-walled diffuser. The original diffuser was not very effective despite the relatively small net diffusion angles. Engineers concluded that the redesign of the valve inlet and diffuser geometry had the potential to deliver a major reduction in the loss coefficient of the valve. Control of these two factors resulted in a very efficient high performance curved wall diffuser.   The flow profile of the valve was optimized through an iterative process in\",\n",

They offer inexpensive acrylic color filters in small booklets of 44 and 100 filters. For the sake of simplicity, keep the number of filters at a minimum as it takes some learning in their use, and in many cases no filter other than #80A is needed ( sometimes not even this filter ).   Any camera or format may be used for light painting as long as it [MASK_NOLOSS] be locked open on a \" B \" or \" T \" setting. As for film, I use Ektachrome 100 slide film at f/16. It is important to adhere to one type of film and the same f-stop to keep the variables to a minimum when experimenting or learning the technique. Experimenting with negative ( print ) film may be simpler due to the film\\'s wider exposure latitude, but printing these negatives may be a problem for the lab, unless you do your own printing and processing. Exposure Determination   The use of an exposure meter, if one is available, would give a starting point for exposure calculations. Actual tests should be carried out on the film, however, to reveal the level of exposure and color balance which are influenced by the reciprocity characteristics of a particular film used. I started out with light measurements, then used Polaroid Type 669 large format film to get immediate feedback of the test exposures. Based on these results, I made a series of bracketed exposures on [MASK_NOLOSS] penlight onto neutral gray ( 18% ) cards and then analyzed the resultant image densities.   Table 1 provides a basic exposure guide for the benefit of those who wish to begin painting with light without extensive testing and auxiliary equipment. This guide is based on the use of the penlight described above, utilizing Type 243 bulb and rechargeable nickel-cadmium ( NiCd ) AA-cell batteries, exposed on Ektachrome Elite II 100 film and a subject of average tonal value. This guide should not be taken as definitive data since large variations may occur between different lighting units, age of the bulb and batteries ( these are not precision items ), type of film and nature of the subject.   I settled on the use of NiCd batteries because of their stable voltage and illumination levels. Fresh alkaline cells gave a meter reading 1EV higher than the NiCd cells, but dropped to the latter values in about 10 minutes of use and slowly but gradually continued to weaken. If alkaline cells are extensively used for light painting, then their',\n",

In May 1992 Baby Cloe was born in London. Cystic fibrosis ran in the family but the use of abortion for genetic selection had been bypassed through the use of pre-implantation genetic testing. That is, several eggs had been removed from the mother\\'s womb and fertilized in vitro with her [MASK_NOLOSS] to develop through the eighth cell division. After that, they were tested for cystic fibrosis. Two of the embryos were without the disease so they were implanted in the mother. One developed and was born. Today pre-implantation genetic screening is used regarding a number of genetic diseases, including sickle-cell anemia and Tay-Sachs.   Besides this neo-eugenic approach to genetic diseases, biotech cures that don\\'t affect heredity have also been developed. One is the genetic engineering of a human growth hormone. Originally intended to help the thousands of U.S. children born with dwarfism, it was patented in the 1980s. Today, however, its wider use among nonaffected children has resulted in $500 million in sales.   And this introduces an ethical concern. Family doctors and pediatricians are increasingly designating children as abnormal who fall in the bottom 3 percent of the height scale for their age group. This common shortness, being defined now as an \" illness, \" results in the growth hormone being more frequently prescribed. It also results in [MASK_NOLOSS] Robin Marantz Henig, writing in the May 1998 Discover magazine, notes that this is \" a common theme in medical history \" -- a treatment developed to resolve an abnormality is eventually used to enhance or standardize normality.   It was, in fact, this very question that induced the National Institutes of Health to bring researchers and ethicists together in September 1997 for the first Gene Therapy Policy Conference. This was followed two weeks later by an American Association for the Advancement of Science-sponsored colloquium on gene alterations directed at the eggs, sperm, and zygotes -- interventions that could, if developed, change an individual\\'s heredity and hence the genetic endowment of future generations. Many speakers at these gatherings expressed concern that the use of such technology could result in a \" biological reinforcement \" of socioeconomic and class distinctions.

       " '[YEAR:1999] power of human beings, draft animals and simple water mills was superseded by new energy sources. The continual availability of energy assured profits, progress and personal success. The assumption that energy is naturally abundant is especially suited to the American laissez-faire ideology, in which the self-reliant individual has only to make use of his own energies in order to rise in the world. The idea of a market for CO 2 emissions is one more expression of this fundamental U.S. [MASK_NOLOSS] paradigm of limited resources into a business opportunity for growth.   In contrast, Europe and much of the rest of the world continue to emphasize mandatory cutbacks of emissions and the creation of a fixed maximum. This is another way of saying that for Europeans energy use is not a measure of culture or progress, and that the market does not appear to be an invisible hand that can be relied upon to prevent long-term ecological problems. Europeans are far more ready to accept scenarios based on the premise that limits are imminent and scarcity is a danger, neither of which fit congenially within the American perception of energy.   Instead, most Americans continue to believe that there are technological solutions to energy problems. There are historical examples that suggest there is some truth to this view. For instance, electricity production has become increasingly efficient. In 1930 the average Con Edison residential customer used 404 kilowatt-hours ( kwh ) of electricity a year. The average bill totaled $29.23 a year, at a rate of $7.03 cents [MASK_NOLOSS] consumption had almost quadrupled to 1,53 6 kwh, but the cost had only doubled to $61.09. In the nation as a whole, consumers averaged almost twice as much, 2,969 kwh in 1956, but they paid only $77.19 for it. ( n37 ) Electricity became cheaper because engineers found ways to extract more from a ton of coal or barrel of oil. By the 1970s it was more difficult -- though not impossible -- to achieve further production efficiencies. On the horizon, however, are superconductor technologies that could make possible higher-efficiency power generation and transmission, low-cost renewable energy technology and improved fuel-cell technology for converting natural gas or hydrogen into electricity.

When the product is a certain kind of food or brand of clothing, insistence does [MASK_NOLOSS] the same things. But when the product is inextricably implicated in a whole way of life, as with the case of energy, path insistence has entirely different long-term implications. In the marketplace for housing, transportation and conveniences, American consumers have for the most part ignored long-term environmental problems such as global warming and given short shrift to the energy needs of the rest of the world, while insisting on their consumption and pollution practices.   But does it matter that the United States consumes more energy than any other nation? There are at least four additional arguments that say it does, aside from scientific evidence from studies that point to global warming and other consequences of overconsumption. The aesthetic environmental argument emphasizes the ugly results of the destruction of natural landscapes by oil exploration, strip mining for coal, acid rain and air pollution. This environmental degradation harms human health and, in the strong form of this argument, threatens human survival. ( n39 ) Second, the egalitarian argument stresses the equality of all peoples [MASK_NOLOSS] generations, who will suffer if Americans consume the majority of the world's energy, fail to recycle and deplete resources. ( n40 ) Third, the leadership argument points to U.S. responsibility as the world's most powerful nation, to set an example of moderation modeled on sustainability, rather than buying the lion's share of resources and flaunting a high-energy lifestyle.   None of these arguments are likely to move those who believe in the self-regulating power of the free market, however. From such a perspective, if aesthetics, equality and global energy leadership become more important to American consumers and voters, then these values will enter into the economic calculus of their energy use.

The influence of government policy on energy market competition is perhaps keenest in the automobile industry So far, German and Japanese automakers have been fastest to respond.

Rethinking the Geopolitics of Energy   Despite these impending changes, discussion of the international politics of energy still oozes oil, shaped more by the crises of the 1970s and 1980s than by the developments of the 1990s or future challenges. ( n80 ) Conflicts over the Caspian Sea, the Middle East and other oil hot spots predominate the literature of energy politics. Over time, however, this emphasis is more likely to shift with the rising influence of climate change on energy policies. Ultimately, the renewable-hydrogen system will likely force us to fundamentally rethink the geopolitics of energy   In 20th-century energy geopolitics, petroleum has been the \" prize, [MASK_NOLOSS], overdependence and even lives lost in war. While the supply of oil may continue to play a part in international relations in the near term, during the last decade environmental pressures have begun to assume an increasingly important role. Under the calculus of the new energy system, the new \" geopolitical imperatives \" are decarbonizing the world economy and delivering energy services to the developing world.

The more firms act in this manner, the more likely and less necessary ratification will become. In any event, at least in the United States, leadership on climate protection has already largely passed from the public to the private sector, simply because efficiency costs less than fuel.

The first is ultralight, ultra-low-drag, hybrid-electric vehicles ( such as Hypercars ) that are highly fuel-efficient, permitting their fuel cell electricity generators to be fed by compact onboard tanks of compressed gaseous hydrogen rather than heavy, expensive onboard \" reformer \" devices that extract hydrogen from liquid fuels. The second precondition is the integration of hydrogen-powered fuel cell market development between vehicles and buildings.   Capturing and reusing waste heat from fuel cells for other applications such as [MASK_NOLOSS] with the traditional forms of energy purchased by most building operators. Such local energy generation could yield even greater economic value wherever electric distribution grids are old or congested, or where other distributed benefits are important and rewarded. Hydrogen fuel could be made in the building by a mass-produced \" hydrogen appliance, \" such as an electrolyzer that separates hydrogen from water using electricity at \" offpeak \" prices -- electricity that is cheaper during periods of low demand such as late at night. Another option is a miniature methane-powered \" reformer \" that uses heat to convert natural gas into hydrogen and carbon dioxide.   There is a huge fuel-cell market in buildings, which use two-thirds of all U.S. electricity Supplemented by industrial niche markets, this buildings market would soon cut fuel-cell costs to levels competitive for use in vehicles. Hypercars need several-fold less power to operate than conventional cars, and could thus adopt fuel cells at prices correspondingly higher than their normally inefficient counterparts could afford. Those higher prices would be reached several years earlier as well [MASK_NOLOSS] hydrogen by first using the spare, off-peak capacity of buildings\\'hydrogen fuel sources to serve vehicles too -- particularly vehicles whose drivers work or live in or near the same buildings. Furthermore, using those vehicles during the workday as plug-in 20-plus-kilowatt power plants could repay a significant fraction of their lease or purchase cost. This building/ vehicle integration could make direct gaseous-hydrogen fueling practical without first constructing a far-flung and costly new infrastructure for bulk hydrogen supply and distribution, since the buildings could make their own hydrogen cost-effectively from available electricity or natural gas. It would also work better and cost less than separating hydrogen from liquid fuels, such as gasoline or methanol, using heavy, expensive devices onboard the cars. Ultimately, plug-in Hypercars could provide five to 10 times as much generating capacity as all utilities now own -- enough in principle to displace essentially all central',\n",

The reasons for cloning are more complex than simply producing identical animals, and in this article we consider those reasons and the results that have [MASK_NOLOSS] the historical context of developmental biology and review results obtained with the procedure. Some readers may wonder how two scientists with cloning experience view the ethics of human cloning. We offer our views in the epilogue. Cloning's roots in nineteenth-century biology   How do cells become specialized during development? One cell, the zygote, gives rise to a multiplicity of cells that in time become increasingly specialized, or differentiated. In the latter part of the nineteenth century, August Weismann believed that differentiation results from the differential and sequential partitioning of the genome as the cells divide ( reviewed by Wilson 1928, Spemann 1938 ). The attractiveness of the now-discarded Weismann hypothesis was that it could be tested. Wilhelm Roux, in an 1888 experiment ( Spemann 1938 ), killed one cell ( blastomere ) of a two-cell amphibian embryo and found that a half-embryo developed, suggesting that some genes are lost during cell replication. However, in 1892, Hans Driesch found that if the blastomeres of two-cell sea urchin embryos were physically separated, [MASK_NOLOSS] ; similar results were obtained when amphibian blastomeres were isolated, provided that they contained a portion of cytoplasm known as gray crescent material. Thus, the genome was not diminished, but rather reproduced during cell division. ( Roux's half-embryos were later interpreted to result from the inhibitory effect of the dead blastomere. )   Blastomere separation of embryos beyond the 2- to 16-cell stage ( depending on species ) was noninformative for testing genomic potential because the cells had too little cytoplasm. But in 1894, Jacques Loeb fortuitously observed that fertilized sea urchin eggs sometimes ruptured when exposed to hypotonic solutions ( Spemann 1938 ). The extruded portion of the egg was usually bereft of a nucleus and remained uncleaved. Occasionally, nuclei traversed the isthmus between the cleaving egg and the extruded cytoplasmic material. In such cases, the extruded cytoplasm cleaved along with the main mass, resulting in the formation of two entire embryos. In 1914, Hans Spemann performed a conceptually identical experiment on an amphibian egg ( Spemann 1938 ). He constricted [MASK_NOLOSS]\",\n",

In such cases, the extruded cytoplasm cleaved along with the main mass, resulting in the formation of two entire embryos. In 1914, Hans Spemann performed a conceptually identical experiment on an amphibian egg ( Spemann 1938 ). He constricted [MASK_NOLOSS] causing the egg to assume the shape of a dumbbell. When the cleaving ( nucleated ) portion reached the 8- or 16-cell stage, he loosened the constriction and permitted a nucleus to move to the non-nucleated cytoplasmic portion. Here, too, the non-nucleated portion cleaved and formed a clone of its nuclear donor.   These primitive nuclear transplantation ( cloning ) experiments affirmed the view that the complete genome is replicated during cell division, at least during early cleavage. The stage was now set for modern cloning experiments to examine the genomic potential of older embryonic cells. However, Spemann ( 1938 ) \" could see no way for the moment \" to manually insert a nucleus from older embryos into enucleated cytoplasm. Robert Briggs and Thomas J. King found a way. Success in Philadelphia   Around 1943, Briggs ( 1911-1983 ), an embryologist working at what is now the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, wanted to determine whether the genome of older somatic nuclei remains equivalent to the zygote nucleus throughout development ( Patterson n.d [MASK_NOLOSS] somatic nucleus into an oocyte whose own nucleus had been removed and then observe what type of development occurred. Briggs was aware that Comandon and de Fonbrune ( 1939 ) had transplanted single nuclei in the unicellular amoeba, but he recognized that nuclear transfer in the oocytes of metazoans would be more arduous because of their complex physiological and biochemical requirements for embryonic development. Over the next 7 years, while analyzing the development of haploid and triploid frog embryos, he became experienced with various microsurgical techniques that would contribute to the procedure of nuclear transfer. In 1948, one of us ( Di Berardino ) joined Briggs\\'s laboratory and was there to witness the first cloning of metazoan animals in 1952.   In 1949, Briggs began searching for a research fellow',\n",

We await a [MASK_NOLOSS] cases, multiple clones were produced from a single donor animal ; these will be valuable for testing pharmaceuticals on animals with an identical genetic ( nuclear ) background. For example, isogenic groups were reported in murine twins and triplets ( Kono et al. 1991 ) and in a group of over 30 animals produced by serial cloning ( i.e., the cloning of clones ; Park et al. 1993, Wakayama et al. 1998 ). Similarly, multiple calves ensued from one donor ( Bondioli et al. 1990, Willadsen et al. 1991, Chesn et al. 1993 ), and 10 calves were produced by serial cloning ( Stice and Keefer 1993 ). Finally, serial cloning of goat nuclei from the 32-cell stage resulted in 45 kids ( Zang and Li 1998 ). Three identical transgenic goats were cloned from fetal cells bearing the human gene for antithrombin III, and one goat is producing the protein in her milk ( Baguisi et al. 1999 ).   Although cloning of preimplantation mammalian nuclei has [MASK_NOLOSS] donor stages, as in amphibians, decreases. Nevertheless, a cloning efficiency adequate for commercial use has been achieved with fetal lamb and calf fibroblast and muscle cells, as well as with adult sheep mammary gland, mouse cumulus, and calf cumulus and oviductal cells.

However, good evidence is lacking on the haemoglobin concentrations at which the risk of death or serious morbidity begins to rise and at which transfusion is indicated.   Methods A retrospective cohort study was performed in 1958 patients, 18 years and older, who underwent surgery and declined blood tranfusion for religious reasons. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality and the secondary outcome was 30-day mortality or in-hospital 30-day morbidity. Cardiovascular disease was defined as a history of angina, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, or peripheral vascular disease.   Findings The 30-day mortality was 3.2% ( 95% CI 2.4-4.0 ). The mortality was 1.3% ( 0.8-2.0 ) in patients with preoperative haemoglobin 12 g/dL or greater and 33.3% ( 18.6-51.0 ) in patients with preoperative haemoglobin less than 6 g/dL. The increase in risk of death associated with low preoperative haemoglobin was more pronounced in patients with cardiovascular disease than in patients without ( interaction p<0.03 ). The effect of blood loss on mortality was larger in patients with low [MASK_NOLOSS] ( interaction p<0.001 ). The results were similar in analyses of postoperative haemoglobin and30-day mortality or in-hospital morbidity.   Interpretation A low preoperative haemoglobin or a substantial operative blood loss increases the risk of death or serious morbidity more in patients with cardiovascular disease than in those without. Decisions about transfusion should take account of cardiovascular status and operative blood loss as well as the haemoglobin concentration.

The purpose of transfusion is to reduce the risks associated with anaemia. However, we know little about the risks of anaemia in the operative setting. Observational studies have been deficient either in failing to control for risk factors for death 9, 10 or in being too small 11 to guide therapy. No investigation has specifically examined the influence of cardiovascular disease on outcome in anaemic patients, despite experimental evidence suggesting that anaemia is less well tolerated in these circumstances. 12-14   We report here an assessment of the risks of surgical mortality and morbidity associated with perioperative anaemia and cardiovascular disease in a large cohort of patients who had refused transfusion. Methods   Population   The study population was drawn from consecutive adults admitted for surgery to a participating hospital between 1981 and 1994 who for religious reasons refused all blood transfusion. We required that the surgical procedure be performed in the operating room, to exclude very [MASK_NOLOSS] because minors can be forced by a court to accept blood transfusions.

A National Death Index search was used to identify deaths that occurred after discharge but within 30 days of the operation. The underlying cause of death was determined by chart review. Anaemia was assigned as the underlying cause of death when patients died from sequelae of severe anaemia without another apparent cause of death.   The secondary outcome was mortality or serious morbidity within 30 days of surgery. In patients discharged before 30 days, morbid conditions were assessed only up to the discharge date.

       " '[YEAR:1999] immunologically unrelated, and therefore the detection of EMA is not due to cross-reactivity or molecular mimicry, is proved by the discordant profile of detection between AGA and EMA in untreated, as well as in treated, CD patients challenged in vitro with gliadin. Since EMA are produced soon after gliadin challenge, and therefore in the earliest phases of CD, they may have a much more important role in the pathogenesis of CD than anticipated.   It remains to be elucidated how gluten challenge leads to EMA production, since there is no evidence to support cross-reactivity or molecular mimicry between gliadin and the self-antigen(s) recognised by EMA, at least at the level of antibody recognition. Indeed, the lack of correlation between AGA and EMA does not support [MASK_NOLOSS] gliadin and the putative antigen recognised by EMA. This possibility is even more unlikely given the absorption experiments that showed that EMA could not cross react with gliadin ( data not shown ).   However, we do have unpublished evidence that, not surprisingly, activation of T cells is required to induce EMA production in the mucosa of CD patients, and that activation of B lymphocytes is required for EMA production, thus excluding the possibility that EMA detection is caused by passive release of EMA stored in plasma cells. Although we can exclude the possibility that gliadin and the EMA antigen share B-cell epitopes, we can not rule out the possibility that gliadin and the EMA antigen have a T-cell epitope with features of molecular mimicry. Indeed, the rules controlling molecular mimicry differ between T and B lymphocytes, and we have shown that apparently unrelated T-cell epitopes can stimulate the same T-cell clone. 12 However, it is remarkable that many individuals with an immunological reaction to gliadin ( healthy controls AGA-positive ) have no detectable EMA and, [MASK_NOLOSS] it is known that T cells reactive against gliadin can be detected in healthy individuals, although different regions of gliadin are recognised. 13   Therefore, although gliadin is the environmental aetiologic factor of CD, the EMA antigen may represent the pathogenetic antigen. Indeed, if reactivity to gliadin is not restricted to CD patients, 6, 13 whereas EMA production is, the question arises of whether the real ( auto ) antigen causing CD is not gliadin but the EMA antigen. Thus, we can envisage a situation in which gliadin, in genetically predisposed individuals, causes an immunological recognition of the EMA antigen',\n",
       " '[YEAR:1999] to several current initiatives that could serve as templates for further efforts. A prototypic example of a successful partnership across sectors, with significant potential for improving the public health, is the development of the acellular pertussis vaccines. Basic research in government and university laboratories helped provide the insights that enabled industry to develop candidate acellular pertussis vaccines. Phase I and phase II clinical trials of these products, supported by industry and government, were conducted at academic medical centres. International efficacy trials, funded and overseen by industry and government through CRADAs and other mechanisms, and facilitated by public health officials through intergovernmental channels, helped provide the data critical for eventual licensure. The new vaccines are more effective and considerably less toxic than the currently used whole-cell products ; their availability will remove a major disincentive to pertussis immunisation.   Close [MASK_NOLOSS] led to the development of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) protease inhibitors, a class of antiretroviral agents that hold particular promise for the treatment of HIV disease when given in combination with the first generation nucleoside and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Basic research in federal and federally supported as well as industrial laboratories was pivotal to the discovery and definition of the HIV protease enzyme, the delineation of the structure of the enzyme, and the development of assays to measure its inhibition. Through a consortium of government, industry, and university-based scientists known as the National Cooperative Drug Discovery Group ( NCDDG ). NIH supported early drug discovery efforts which in turn set the stage for industry to develop specific compounds, test them ( sometimes in university-based, federally sponsored clinical trials networks such as the AIDS Clinical Trials Group ), and bring them to market. Government-sponsored consortia such as the NCDDG will serve an increasingly important function as the public and private sector work together to maximise opportunities. Other alliances, under the auspices of the private [MASK_NOLOSS] collaboration.   The government also can play a critical role in providing scientists with reagents that might otherwise not be shared because of proprietary interests. Of growing importance are repositories such as the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program of the NIH that has an inventory of approximately 200 000 specimens. More than 900 different kinds of specimens including antibodies, recombinant DNA clones, cell lines, proteins, viruses, and chemicals are available for distribution to scientists from academia, industry, and government, in the United States and throughout the world.

       " \"[YEAR:1999]Section : Early reports Summary   Background The cows'milk hypothesis for the cause of insulin-dependent diabetes ( IDDM ) is based on the concept that early consumption of cows'milk may expose the immune system to a foreign protein possessing immunological cross-reactivity with an antigen present on pancreatic b-cells.   Methods We measured in-vitro peripheral lymphocyte response to b casein, a protein in cows'milk, in 47 patients with recent-onset IDDM, in 36 healthy people and, to test disease specificity, in 10 patients with autoimmune thyroid disease. Other antigens tested for were bovine serum albumin, purified protein derivative, human serum albumin, and phytohaemagglutinin.   Results Specific proliferation of T lymphocytes with bovine b casein was seen in patients with IDDM ( mean SD age 18.7 9 ) with a significant difference in mean stimulation index ( SI ) versus healthy people ( p<0.00001 ) or patients with autoimmune thyroid disease ( p<0.002 ). 24 of 47 ( 51.1% ) patients with IDDM versus 0/10 patients with thyroid disease and 1/36 ( 2.7% ) healthy people had a positive response to b casein defined [MASK_NOLOSS] healthy people ( p<0.00001 ). No significant differences were observed between the groups of subjects with respect to other antigens tested.   Interpretation The association between IDDM and early consumption of cows'milk may be explained by the generation of a specific immune response to b casein. Exposure to cows'milk triggers a cellular and humoral anti-b casein immune response which may cross-react with a beta-cell antigen. It is of interest that sequence homologies exist between b casein and several b-cell molecules.   Lancet 1996 ; 348 : 926-28 Introduction   Epidemiological and ecological investigations suggest that early infant nutrition, particularly drinking cows'milk may induce autoimmunity leading to insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus ( IDDM ). 1-4 A supporting hypothesis is of immunological cross-reactivity between a fragment of bovine serum albumin and a b-cell protein of 69.000M ( p69 ) because both cellular and humoral immune responses to bovine serum albumin have been reoported in patients with IDDM which cross-react with p69. 5-7 Other studies, however, have not confirmed these findings. 8, 9 Among other proteins present in [MASK_NOLOSS] that a protein-free diet in non-obese diabetic ( NOD ) mice, prevents\",\n",

Several variants of b casein are known ; over the past 10 years, the production of cows\\'milk containing the A1 variant has been encouraged over production of milk with the A2 variant, mainly because of its high protein content ( Elliott RB, personal communication ). In-vitro enzymatic digestion of b casein ( both human and bovine ) yields peptides with anti-hypertensive, opioid, and immunomodulating activity on human phagocytes with receptors for these peptides. 12 Some of these peptides occur after gastrointestinal digestion of cow\\'s milk including bovine b casomorphins ( residues 60-70 ) which differ from the homologous region [MASK_NOLOSS] casein share approximately 70% homology and sequence differences could be therefore responsible for the generation of an immune response if milk proteins are introduced within the first weeks of life when the intestine is permeable to proteins. 14 Based on results in NOD mice 10, 11 and evidence that patients with IDDM have autoantibodies to b casein at the time of diagnosis, 15 we measured T-cell reactivity to b casein in patients with recent-onset IDDM, in a group of patients affected by another autoimmune endocrinopathy ( autoimmune thyroid disease ), and in healthy people.

Discussion   We have shown that lymphocytes from a large proportion of patients with recent-onset IDDM proliferate in response to b casein, a finding which reinforces the concept of this protein being involved in causing the disease as indicated by the recent report of autoantibodies to b casein in these patients. 15 This finding is specific for patients with IDDM because no lymphocyte proliferation to b casein was observed with cells from patients affected by autoimmune thyroid disease. A proliferative response to b casein in patients with IDDM diagnosed in childhood and as young adults suggests that this response has pathogenic relevance regardless of the age of onset of the disease.

Protective anti-HIV immune responses may prevent HIV infection completely, may allow only transient infection, leading to clearance of virus, or may merely limit the extent of HIV infection, but in so doing prevent the development of AIDS. One suggestion is that clearance of HIV occasionally occurs after both maternal-fetal HIV transmission 13, 14 and sexual transmission of HIV. 15 Consequently, if protective anti-HIV immune [MASK_NOLOSS] person, protection might be achieved via early termination of HIV infection.   What are protective anti-HIV cellular immune responses?   Less effective anti-HIV CD8 CTL responses may be oligoclonal with respect to T-cell receptor ( TCR ) Vb usage and targeted at several non-immunodominant HIV CTL epitopes, whereas more effective anti-HIV CTL responses may be polyclonal and targeted at fewer immunodominant epitopes. 6, 15, 16 These observations, together with data suggesting that the inheritance of certain HLA-encoded or other host genes may be associated with either rapid progression or non-progression to AIDS, 1 indicate that host gene expression may determine the quality and/or quantity of host anti-HIV immune responses. This could occur via HLA or HLA-related genes ( a ) by determining which HIV epitopes are recognised by CTL or T helper cells ; ( b ) by determining which TCR Va and Vb regions are used in the CTL and T helper cell anti-HIV responses ; or ( c ) by other events such as regulation of',\n",

This CD8 \" HIV suppressor \" activity, which is initially present in rapid progressors and declines with the onset of AIDS, 17 may be partly mediated by cytokines such as interleukin ( IL ) -16, 18 and by the chemokines, RANTES, MIP-1a, and MIP-1b. 19 Feng and colleagues 20 lately reported a novel host molecule, fusin, which is required for T-cell tropic HIV to infect CD4 T cells ; this molecule shows 37% homology with a known chemokine receptor, the IL-8 receptor.   These discoveries regarding HIV-host interactions have led to new ways of thinking about protective host responses to HIV infection, and have provided new insight into the types of immune cell responses that may need to be induced by an HIV immunogen. Thus, for induction of CD8 \" HIV suppressor \" cells, CD8 CTL, and CD4 T helper cells by an HIV immunogen, one probably needs immunogens that induce these anti-HIV responses to a sufficient number of HIV variants so [MASK_NOLOSS].   What are protective anti-HIV antibody responses?   Sullivan et al 10 lately showed that anti-recombinant ( r ) gp120 envelope antibodies raised in animals or in human volunteers neutralise HIV grown in laboratory-adapted T-cell lines but not primary isolates of the virus grown in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. This observation raises important questions about the roles of various specificities of neutralising antibodies in protection against HIV.

A key obstacle to vaccine development is the extraordinary variability of HIV and the rapidity and extent of HIV mutation. 25 Recent data in patients treated with antiretroviral drugs have shown that, after initiation of treatment, HIV variants emerge rapidly, and can be isolated from peripheral blood by 3 weeks. 26, 27 Moreover, as many as 10 9 new HIV virions are produced in an infected individual per day, and the half-life of HIV variants is about 2 days. 26, 27   Myers and colleagues 28 analysed HIV sequences world wide and divided HIV isolates into groups or clades, providing a basis for evalulating [MASK_NOLOSS].

These researchers suggest that as many as 10% of HIV isolates are mosaics of recombination ; if so, vaccines based on only one clade will not protect immunised individuals from mosaic isolates. However, for preventive HIV vaccine development, the degree of HIV variation that must be dealt with is unknown, since the viruses isolated early during HIV infection are relatively homogeneous in sequence. 31   What do we have now?   The table summarises some of the general types of HIV or simian immunodeficiency virus ( SIV ) immunogens being tested in animals or in man, and the types of immune responses that these immunogens induce. The most encouraging results in retrovirus protection trials so [MASK_NOLOSS] live SIV strains : the resulting infection by the attenuated SIV strain provided full protection from challenge with highly virulent SIV 2 years later. 32 Shiramizu and colleagues 33 have reported a common site of integration of HIV in T-cell tumours that occur in HIV-infected patients, suggesting that HIV may be oncogenic. Baba et al 34 showed that nef-deleted attenuated SIV strains, whilst non-pathogenic for adult rhesus monkeys, induced fatal disease in newborn monkeys. In view of these data, there is considerable concern about development and use of a live-attenuated vaccine in human beings. 12 Moreover, for immunisation with attenuated HIV strains as well as with any of the non-HIV live vectors that contain HIV proteins, the problem of HIV variability remains, possibly necessitating the use of a multivalent immunogen irrespective of HIV immunogen type. Thus, the large number of HIV variants available for transmission and the possible immunodominant nature of what may be protective anti-HIV T-cell responses have suggested the need for HLA-based HIV subunit vaccines. 35-40   What are HLA-based HIV vaccines?

Such a mixture of immunogens could range from a mixture of non-HIV vectors expressing HIV proteins, to mixtures of HIV recombinant proteins and/or synthetic peptides ( table ). 35-38, 40, 41   The implications of such a vaccine design are : ( a ) depending on the immunogen, not all members of a cohort may have an immunogenic HIV epitope present to bind to their particular HLA antigens ; ( b ) not all relevant HIV variants would probably be represented in an immunogen [MASK_NOLOSS] for specific geographical locations, and perhaps even for specific ethnic groups within them ; and ( d ) such vaccine formulations would almost certainly be less than 100% effective in the vaccinated cohorts. 1   The datasets that are needed to develop HLA-based AIDS vaccines are now becoming available : Compilation of CD8 CTL and CD4 T helper epitopes in HIV proteins 29, 42 Listing of the HLA restricting antigens that present HIV CTL and T helper epitopes 29 Compilation of HIV variants present in specific geographical locations 28, 29 Listing of HLA types for some ethnic groups in geographical locations. 43   The panel shows an example of a theoretical HLA-based HIV vaccine design for CTL induction for African-Americans.

Theoretically, such immunogens could be designed by expanding the number of HLA types used in the analysis and by choosing HIV CTL immunogenic epitopes presented by several disparate HLA molecules. 29, 38 Ward et al 39 have suggested that, since several HIV CTL epitopes are presented by more than one allotype of HLA class I molecules, by using nine CTL epitopes ( as well as variant peptides that reflect HIV mutations at these sites ) 95.4% of African-Americans, 97.5% of Caucasian Americans, 99.4% of Native Americans, and 97.2% of Thais would theoretically respond to such an HIV immunogen.   There are considerable limitations and concerns of such an analysis ( panel ). For example, we do not know whether the degree of variability seen in existing databases reflects the true degree of HIV variability in all patients, or whether all variants of each HLA type will equally present each peptide to T cells. Another unknown factor is whether each HIV CTL epitope variant will be a potent agonist and trigger T [MASK_NOLOSS] well-documented examples of mutations in HIV T-cell epitopes that modify peptide presentation. 16, 36   If subunits of HIV proteins larger than individual synthetic HIV immunogenic peptides are used in HIV immunogens ( eg, whole proteins containing multiple immunogenic epitopes ), such as might be expressed in non-HIV live vectors or in HIV pseudovirions, there would be less concern with \" matching \" the common HLA antigens with CTL and T-helper epitopes in the immunogens.

The work of Sullivan et al 10 implies that envelope oligomers of HIV primary isolates may be appropriate immunogens for induction of anti-HIV neutralising antibodies against primary HIV isolates grown in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Future studies should focus on the envelope of HIV primary isolates as the target of neutralising antibodies. If HIV envelope oligomers are successful in inducing antibodies that neutralise HIV primary isolates, the neutralising antibody specificity may be variant specific and, if so, the issue of HIV variability would still need to be addressed.

Key words   adolescents   satisfaction   sickle-cell disease   support groups   For adolescents with sickle cell disease ( SCD ), adolescence is complicated by the physical, social, and psychological stresses of living with a chronic illness. Although there is little systematic knowledge of the effect of SCD on this transition to adulthood, evidence suggests that developmental delays are common. Physically, delayed growth and onset of puberty are common developmental problems ( Platt, [MASK_NOLOSS] developmental concerns center around feelings of powerlessness ( Borck, 1989 ) and dependence on parents and health care providers ( Conyard, Krihnamurthy, &; Dosik, 1980 ). Psychologically, adolescents with SCD tend to be more depressed and have lower self-esteem than their healthier counterparts ( Seigel, Golden, Gough, Lashley, &; Sacker, 1990 ). In addition, because SCD is characterized by unpredictable, acute episodes of pain and debilitation, it is not uncommon for children and adolescents with SCD to have, by age 16 or 17, repeated one or more grades in school as a result of illness-related absences ( Nishiura &; Whitten, 1980 ), thus further hindering social and psychological development.   Support groups generally are considered valuable to people with chronic diseases such as SCD. In addition to reducing isolation and fostering a sense of identity through the focus on a common problem, support groups have the potential to bridge gaps in traditional services ( Schopler &; Galinsky, 1993 ). Support groups foster an atmosphere of empowerment [MASK_NOLOSS], 1992 ; Katz, 1992 ). This network of support can have a positive effect on health.

The challenge to the lawyer is to become familiar with this wide range of fields.

And the exposure aspect of environmental tort cases involves still other kinds of expertise, such as chemical analysis and environmental chemistry.   Epidemiology and toxicology usually are the basis for showing that a substance is capable of causing disease, while medical testimony usually is offered on the diagnosis of the plaintiffs injury and as the link between the exposure and the plaintiffs disease. Epidemiology requires expertise in statistics and demographics, as well as in the mechanisms of disease causation and potential confounding causes.   Controversies over epidemiological evidence are likely to include issues about whether the results are statistically significant, whether the study has the power to detect a positive association at the appropriate magnitude [MASK_NOLOSS]   Toxicological evidence also may be controversial. Where environmental toxins are concerned, toxicological studies are likely to have been done on animals, such as rats or mice, or on single-cell organisms or isolated groups of cells. The relevance of such studies to humans is often questioned.   Medical testimony may be used for a variety of purposes in an environmental tort case -- from identifying the plaintiffs disease and projecting the likely course for the purpose of damages assessment to connecting the epidemiological and toxicological evidence with the plaintiffs illness.   Scientific evidence in tort cases may be screened in a pretrial hearing under the standards of Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, the 1993 Supreme Court decision that recognized a gatekeeping role for trial judges to determine the reliability of scientific expert testimony.

       " '[YEAR:2000]Section : Commentary   Eosinophils have long been linked with asthma, but only recently have striking advances been made in the understanding of the mechanisms of eosinophil accumulation in the airways. One key advance was recognition that airway eosinophilia is orchestrated by the actions of airway CD4+ T cells. In patients with asthma, these cells are mainly of the Th2 subclass, whereas normally the Th1 subclass predominates. 1 These two subclasses of T-helper cells differ in their production of cytokines and are reciprocally inhibitory. Th2 lymphocytes produce interleukins 4, 5, 9, and 13, which activate mechanisms important in defence against parasites and in allergic inflammation. Such mechanisms include IgE production, mast-cell differentiation, and eosinophil growth, migration, and activation. Th1 lymphocytes produce interferon-g and interleukin-2, which activate mechanisms important in defence against viruses and bacteria. 2   A mechanism accounting for the predominance of Th2 cells in the asthmatic airway was suggested by the discovery that the context in which antigen-presenting cells process and present allergens critically influences the pattern of T-helper-cell differentiation. The presence of interleukin-12 ( together with interleukin-18 ) [MASK_NOLOSS] CD4+ precursor T cells into the Th1 subclass ; its absence promotes differentiation into the Th2 subclass. 3 The presence or absence of interleukin-12 during antigen presentation, and thus the type of effector CD4+ T cell, may be shaped by concomitant infections and the nature of the inhaled allergens.   These advances suggest two novel approaches to the treatment of asthma : one is to block interleukin-5, the Th2 cytokine most important in promoting the growth, attraction, and activation of eosinophils ; 4 the other is to administer interleukin-12 to shift the T-helper- lymphocyte population in the airway towards Th1 cells ( figure ). Both of these approaches inhibit allergen-induced airway hyper-responsiveness and allergen-induced eosinophilia in animal models. 3,4 Clinical studies of both approaches are reported in this issue of The Lancet.   Margaret Leckie and colleagues examined the efficacy of a monoclonal antibody to interleukin-5 in allergic asthmatic volunteers by examining its effects on numbers of circulating eosinophils and on the airway responses to inhalation of allergen. They found that a single injection of the antibody was well tolerated and [MASK_NOLOSS] sputum, which then remained low throughout the study. But this fall in eosinophils was not accompanied by changes in the early or late response to allerg',\n",
       " \"[YEAR:2000] of eosinophilic activity. And the fundamental objection will be raised that allergen challenge is so artifactual a way of provoking an asthmatic attack that prediction of the efficacy of a therapy can not be based on its effect on the response to allergen challenge. For example, it is possible that suppression of airway eosinophils over a long period could reduce asthma symptoms or exacerbation rates even though allergen challenge responses are not reduced shortly after eosinophil suppression. Not all of these objections can be rebutted. But it is worth noting that the allergen-challenge model has held up pretty well as a method for assessing drug efficacy in asthma. Of the drugs effective in controlling asthma, inhaled corticosteroids, cromolyn, theophylline, leukotriene antagonists, and anti-IgE antibody all inhibit the late response to allergen. [MASK_NOLOSS] does not prove that such a result will never be obtained, the findings reported in today's Lancet must be discouraging to the investigators involved in a trial being conducted to find out whether antibody to interleukin-5 can control asthma.   Another likely response to the implication that eosinophils may not be important in the physiological disturbances of asthma is that it is unsurprising ; there is already plenty of evidence against the central place assigned to eosinophils and to interleukin-5 in asthma. Leckie and colleagues note some of this evidence in their discussion. Bronchial-biopsy specimens and induced- sputum samples from asthmatic patients do not always reveal an excess of eosinophils. 5 And in at least some mouse models of asthma, airway responses to antigen challenge require neither interleukin-5 nor immunoglobulins ( eg, IgE ), but do require CD4+ T lymphocytes. 6 These findings may foreshadow the next shift in concepts about asthma -- that products of CD4+ T cells induce the asthma phenotype through airway effects of cytokines such as interleukins 13 and 9, which are not leucocyte dependent. 7-9   [MASK_NOLOSS] and if Bryan and colleagues'finding of a reduction in number of eosinophils means that a shift from Th2 to Th1 lymphocytes actually occurred, why did interleukin-12 not alter the responses to allergen challenge? This question can not be answered simply. One likely explanation is that the main effect of interleukin-12 is in promoting early T-helper-cell differentiation, at the time of initial antigen presentation. 3 Another explanation is that the idea that asthma reflects an imbalance of Th1 and Th2 cells is far too simple.

Some studies of sensitised mice have shown that Th1 cells do not counterbalance Th2-mediated effects but may worsen airway inflammation. 10 And in an ocular model of allergic inflammation in mice, one study of interleukin-12 suggested that this cytokine is necessary for late-phase allergic inflammation, and that giving recombinant murine interleukin-12 increases mononuclear-cell infiltration. 11   The two studies reported today are a reminder that treatment strategies for asthma that prove successful when tested in laboratory animals do not always work as well in equivalent studies in human beings. In addition, these treatment approaches can [MASK_NOLOSS] represent only the first round of studies of therapies directed at specific cytokines involved in allergic airway inflammation. Long-term studies of these approaches, and the identification of new cytokine targets, may give a different picture.

Indeed, in a randomised, controlled, double-blind crossover comparison, low-dose dobutamine ( 200 mg/min ) improved glomerular filtration rate but dopamine did not. 24   Doubts about the efficacy of low-dose dopamine as a renal protective agent have been counterbalanced by the perception that it is extremely safe. Lately, however, doubts about safety have also been raised. Dopamine decreases serum prolactin concentrations and, thereby, induces a transient decrease in T-cell function, 6 which may impair resistance to infection. Dopamine also decreases growth-hormone secretion and thyrotropin release. 5 Growth-hormone deficiency can contribute to a negative nitrogen balance in critical illness. Low-dose dopamine contributed to mucosal hypoxia in an experimental model of haemorrhagic shock. 7 Other adverse effects include depression of respiratory drive and a proarrhythmic effect. 11 These effects are unpredictable because dopamine clearance and metabolism are altered in acutely ill patients, leading to extreme variability in plasma dopamine concentrations even at steady-state infusion rates. 25, 26 Controversy about the [MASK_NOLOSS] 4, 27-29   Our study, which had sufficient statistical power to detect a small change in glomerular filtration rate, found that the peak serum creatinine concentration was similar in the dopamine and placebo groups.

These two points have an important bearing on treatment with respect to the clinical course of HIV infection.   We now know that there is extensive viral replication and turnover early in HIV infection, 8, 9 followed by the continued presence of virus in the blood even when the infection is symptomless. 10 Although the symptomless phase of infection with HIV has been called clinically \" latent \", this term may be a misnomer. When an infection, whether viral or with a higher organism such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is deemed to be latent, replication of the organism involved is usually thought to be low or nil. This is clearly not [MASK_NOLOSS] of total virus in plasma has been shown to be a predictor of progression to AIDS. 11-13 Mellors et al 14 lately showed that the extent of viraemia may be a better marker of disease progression than CD4 T-cell counts ; these researchers found that patients with counts greater than 500/mL can develop AIDS and die as rapidly as those with lower counts if they have a greater degree of viraemia.   As for resistance, a high level of resistance to zidovudine is associated with more rapid progression to AIDS or death during therapy with this agent. 15 The error-prone nature of HIV replication that underlies resistance is not particular to this virus but is a general property of RNA viruses. 16 Viral',\n",

As for resistance, a high level of resistance to zidovudine is associated with more rapid progression to AIDS or death during therapy with this agent. 15 The error-prone nature of HIV replication that underlies resistance is not particular to this virus but is a general property of RNA viruses. 16 Viral resistance to the nucleoside inhibitors of reverse transcriptase may result from multiple drug resistant strains and can involve at least five different mutations. Some of these mutations may affect the binding site for the phosphorylated drug within the reverse transcriptase. 17 Overall, more than 20 mutations have been associated with resistance to various anti-HIV drugs.   At the end of 1993, [MASK_NOLOSS] infection. 18 In agreement with the Concorde study, no therapy with zidovudine was recommended for symptom-free individuals with CD4 counts greater than 500/mL. However, with developments in our understanding of HIV replication and mutation as well as the introduction of new agents to combat the virus, these treatment recommendations have become obsolete. 19 Now, the challenge is to find the best treatment course. Based on the observation that the virus has a rapid turnover rate initially during the infection, one suggestion is that HIV infection should be hit \" early and hard \". 20 Although this approach may seem logical and analogies have been made to the treatment of childhood leukaemia and to tuberculosis, this concept has not yet been proven for HIV infection. Moreover, we do not know which combination of agents would be most appropriate.   Because of the rapid turnover of virus and the development of resistance, the rationale for combination therapy is obvious. Lamivudine, the newest nucleoside analogue to be released, may be especially useful in this respect. When [MASK_NOLOSS] and increases CD4 counts more than does zidovudine alone. 21 However, when lamivudine is used by itself resistance develops rapidly. Another study showed that the lamivudine/zidovudine combination led to a \" beneficial \" pattern of resistance : a resistance mutation occurred that made the virus resistant to lamivudine but caused the previously zidovudine-resistant virus to become sensitive to zidovudine. 22 This lamivud',\n",

Benzamide compounds have been developed that seem to inhibit HIV virus through an interaction with these proteins. 40 Recently endogenous substances from lymphocytes, [MASK_NOLOSS] may interfere with a newly described co-receptor involved in HIV infection. 43 These substances may have therapeutic potential in combating infection with HIV. Conclusions   With new agents under development, and the use of drug combinations, antiviral therapy for HIV infection seems to be in a more optimistic stage than it was several years ago. The table lists the approved drugs for treatment of HIV infection. The indications are not given, since they change with each new piece of information gained. For example, some drugs have monotherapy given as the \" official \" package insert indication. Monotherapy may in fact be a questionable practice, since combination therapy seems to be more important in treatment, as recently shown in the Delta trial. 44 Although, as discussed above, early treatment has been suggested, this has not yet been confirmed by clinical trials. Finally, the long-term outcome of various encouraging treatment combinations is unknown. As the treatment of HIV infection becomes more complex, care givers will require greater skill. A study examining time periods [MASK_NOLOSS] of the primary care physician in treating HIV infection is an important factor in patient survival. 45 Since treatment strategies are now more complex, physician experience and training become even more important in the appropriate management of this devasting disease.

Enrolment and immunisations   The study was conducted under a clinical protocol that was approved by the ethics and scientific review committees of the Faculty of Tropical Medicine of Mahidol University and the Office of the Surgeon General of the US Army, and was also approved by the Karen Refugee Committee. 6 months before the trial, a cohort of 1000 schoolchildren ( 5-15years ) was identified and followed prospectively. The cohort was augmented to 1547 in the month before the first dose, with children aged 2-5 years.

At each of the three scheduled vaccinations, a separate clinical and laboratory examination ( including malaria smear ) was performed if the child was febrile or otherwise ill.

The primary endpoint also includes all symptomatic cases of mixed P falciparum and P vivax infections. Severe malaria was defined according to the WHO criteria. 10 Patients with parasitaemia more than 4% but with no other signs of severe malaria were also classified in this group because in previous studies in this community ( 1990-92 ) this subgroup had a mortality rate of 3%. 11 Symptomless malaria was defined as the presence of asexual stages of P falciparum on the blood smear in the absence of symptoms for at least 4 days before and 14 days after the positive smear. The primary endpoint for determination of efficacy was defined as the time to first episode of symptomatic pure or mixed P falciparum infection during the 15 months following the administration of three correct doses of vaccine. Intent-to-treat analyses were also performed with treatment group defined by the first vaccine received.

One slide was read on site and the duplicate slide was referred to the Armed Forces Research Institute of the Medical Sciences ( AFRIMS ) in Bangkok for independent reading. Periodically, results from the two readings were compared and the laboratory heads reconciled any differences. For each blood slide, 200 high-power thick film fields were examined. Parasite densities ( parasites/mL ) were calculated from the number of parasites per 500 white blood cells or parasitised erythrocytes per 1000 erythrocytes corrected for the white or red cell counts, respectively.

The estimates of odds ratios and their confidence intervals, both overall and by age, were calculated by exponentiation of the relevant linear predictors.   Vaccine efficacy was computed from the standard formula PREFORMATTED TABLE   where I v is the incidence rate in the vaccinated and I c is the incidence rate in the control group. Incidence rates were calculated as the numbers of first episodes divided by child-months at risk. Standard errors and confidence intervals for the efficacy estimates were derived by use of bootstrap sampling where the larger of repetitions was the minimum of 1000 or the number of observations in the subgroup. 15 Results   1348 children were enrolled, 659 ( 49% ) girls and 689 ( 51% ) boys ( table 1 ). One-third of the children were under 6 years old. Of those enrolled, 1221 met the criteria for inclusion in the primary efficacy analysis. The groups were very well balanced at baseline in terms of [MASK_NOLOSS] packed-cell volume ( table 2 ). Children with an incomplete follow-up were distributed evenly across age groups and by sex. The mean actual months of follow-up for the primary analysis ( ie, until the first case of P falciparum ) was 10.0 ( 85% of maximum ). The first dose of vaccine was administered in October, 1993, the second a month later, and the third in April, 1994. The trial was extended by 3 months beyond its original completion date to July, 1995, because of cross-border military incursions during the spring of 1995. Most of the loss to follow-up occurred at this time, and the observation period was extended to ensure that the expected numbers of cases were detected.   Adverse effects   Both vaccines were generally well tolerated. There were no severe life-threatening side-effects ; however, immediate allergic reactions were observed in 26 children receiving the SPf66 vaccine and in none in the control group ( Fisher's exact test, p<0.0001 ). These reactions included localised oedema or urticaria ( five [MASK_NOLOSS] children ), and in 24 children ( 3.6% ) peculiar bilateral cutaneous reactions described previously by Patarroyo et al. 16 The bilateral reactions consisted of localised erythema and oedema occurring at the site of a previous injection within minutes of a second or third dose in the contralateral arm.

A previous trial had indicated greater efficacy of the SPf66 vaccine in very young children ( aged 1 to 4 years ) than in older children. 5 Therefore we had specified an analysis of efficacy restricted to the younger ( <6 years old ) children. In the 329 children under 6 years old there were 46 first episodes of falciparum malaria in those receiving SPf66, compared with 58 episodes in those receiving hepatitis B vaccine ; estimated vaccine efficacy 21% ( 95% CI 29 to 55 ; p=0.22 ). On the other hand, in the larger group of 895 children 6 years and older, there were 149 cases in the SPf66 group versus 126 in the comparator group ( estimated vaccine efficacy 224% ( 95% CI 258 to +6 ; p=0.09 ). To address this issue further, we studied the interaction between age and [MASK_NOLOSS] trend with age ( Breslow-Day test for the homogeneity of odds ratios, p=0.15 ). The relative risk by age shows no apparent trend ( figure 3 ). In addition, logistic regression analysis demonstrated no evidence for a significant relation between body weight or vaccine dose per kilogram and efficacy ( data not shown ). These data show that assessment of vaccine efficacy was unrelated to age, size, or vaccine dose. Parasitaemias over 4% were more common in those who received SPf66, but the difference was not statistically significant ( p=0.21, table 5 ). Otherwise the distribution of parasitaemias was similar in the two groups ( table 6 ). There was a small but significant reduction in packed-cell volume ( 1% ) among recipients of hepatitis B vaccine with pure P falciparum infections as compared with recipients of SPf66 ( p=0.01 ). P vivax infections were common during the study, but the incidence was the same in the two groups ( table 7 ).   None of the cases detected by smears during the cross-sectional surveys [MASK_NOLOSS] evaluation of symptoms within 14 days was judged symptom-free, and therefore all were included in the primary efficacy group.

Though the numbers are small, there was no evidence of any vaccine effect on the parasite densities, spleen rates, or packed-cell volume. Symptomless falciparum malaria was extremely uncommon during the study ( n=13 ; seven SPf66, six hepatitis B vaccine ). Discussion   The SPf66 malaria vaccine did not protect Karen children living in northwestern Thailand from clinical falciparum malaria. Compared with children who received hepatitis B vaccine, recipients of the SPf66 vaccine had no reduction in first episodes of falciparum malaria, no decrease in the frequency of episodes of severe malaria, and no reduction in parasite densities. Importantly, the SPf66 vaccine did not attenuate the clinical manifestations or severity of falciparum malaria and did not reduce the proportion of cases that were symptomatic. These negative results, showing [MASK_NOLOSS] to +14% ), must be considered in the context of previously reported studies. A series of preliminary trials from South America, all of which showed evidence of vaccine efficacy, was followed by three detailed randomised double-blind studies ; the SPf66 vaccine was significantly protective in Colombia, 5 of borderline efficacy in Tanzania, 3 and completely ineffective in the Gambia. 4   This study in Thailand was large and detailed ; 1221 children were seen every day for 21 months. There were 379 evaluable first cases of symptomatic falciparum malaria during the 15-month period of observation, thereby achieving a 90% and 80% power to detect a 30% and 25% efficacy of vaccine, respectively. Thus this study is similar in scope to the 396 first symptomatic cases among 1548 volunteers reported in the Colombian study, and is much larger than the 218 first symptomatic cases in 630 infants in the Gambian trial and the 123 first symptomatic cases among 586 children in the Tanzanian trial. There were substantial differences in the age range and case definition between the Thai and [MASK_NOLOSS] the western border of Thailand ( estimated entomological inoculation rate 0.3/year ) than it is in Tanzania where the rate approaches 300/year.

In HIV-positive persons, HL heralds more rapid progression to AIDS. 3, 6, 13 HL is also seen in other forms of immunosuppression -- eg, among organ or bone-marrow recipients and those receiving long-term steroid therapy. 15 A few cases have been reported in immunocompetent individuals. 16 The lesion presents as a white patch, often corrugated or even \" hairy \" in appearance, typically on the lateral margin of the tongue ( figure 1 ).

Furthermore, some of the microscopic appearances associated with HL can be seen in necropsy specimens of clinically normal tongue. 19 Thus, evidence of the presence of EBV is required for definitive diagnosis of HL, although presumptive diagnosis can be made on clinical appearance alone. 17   The gamma-herpes virus EBV is present in the epithelial [MASK_NOLOSS] on electron microscopy, as viral antigen detectable by immunocytochemistry, and as fully replicating high copy number EBV-DNA present as the complete genome in linear virion form demonstrable by Southern blotting. 20 In-situ hybridisation is suitable for identification of EBV DNA in HL, 21 and EBV RNA can be also detected by use',\n",

Some warts show epithelial atypia 30 and these contain new HPV types. Oral warts can be removed surgically with various techniques, but the recurrence rate is high. Malignant transformation has not been seen. Periodontal disease   Some unusual and often severe periodontal infections are seen in individuals with HIV infection. Linear gingival erythema ( formerly known as HIV-gingivitis ) is a red band at the gingival margin in children or adults. It does not seem to be due to inflammation, is frequently not associated with plaque accumulation, and may not completely resolve with therapy directed towards gingivitis.

The epidemiology and pathogenesis of this lesion remain uncler. Prevalence estimates range from very low in otherwise symptom-free HIV-positive individuals 31 to 6-10% in a population with significant HIV-related disease. 32 Cigarette smoking seems to be a cofactor in this condition. 33 The pathogenesis may involve a loss of helper T-cell activity ( on which immunological response to the periodontal flora depends ), polymorphonuclear cell defects, and specific microorganisms yet to be determined. The role of microorganisms is questionable since several studies have failed to identify pronounced differences from the bacterial flora found in conventional chronic inflammatory periodontal disease. 34 Therapy consists of local measures, with mechanical debridement, root planing, and irrigation with povidone-iodine. This treatment may be combined with the use of systemic antibiotics and home use of chlorhexidine mouth rinses.

Although new perforate tissue and apical branches are formed exclusively at the apical margin of the thallus nets ( Figure 20 ), considerable tissue expansion occurs diffusely throughout the reticulum ( Sanders 1989, 1992 ). Some umbilicate lichens ( i.e., [MASK_NOLOSS] umbilicus \" ) also appear to show diffuse growth ( Hestmark 1997 ). Diffuse growth probably occurs in other species as well ( Honegger 1993 ), but at present lichen growth patterns remain largely unstudied.   The presence of diffuse growth in at least some lichens raises fundamental questions about the mechanisms of thallus growth at the cellular level. Can these growth processes be compared with those exhibited by nonlichen fungi or even those of conventional plants? Because thallus structural tissue is fungal in most lichens, it might be expected that the component fungal cells are behaving essentially as hyphae. However, growth of the vegetative fungal hypha occurs exclusively at the tip. In this zone, the wall exhibits plasticity, and new cell wall components are added to the existing structure during growth ( Wessels 1986 ).   Exclusively apical growth of component fungal cells can not account for diffuse growth of the lichen thallus. The mechanical tissue of R. menziesii, for example, is constructed of elongate fungal cells forming an anastomosing network embedded in thick [MASK_NOLOSS] With extensive diffuse growth of the thallus, these fungal cells must somehow maintain plasticity along their length. Such diffuse plasticity is indeed known in certain specialized cells of nonlichen fungi, such as those of the mushroom stipe ( Craig and Gull 1977, Mol and Wessels 1990 ) or zygomycete sporangiophore ( Burnett 1979 ). The specialized hyphae of these nonlichen fungi have been shown experimentally to incorporate structural components into a cell wall extending along its entire length, allo wing the wall to maintain its integrity while elongating diffusely.

Instead, new wall layers are continually produced to the cell interior as older layers are disrupted by the continued diffuse growth of the thallus ( Figure 23 ). Remnants of the older wall layers accumulate in massive quantities between neighboring cells, forming a dense intercellular matrix.

In addition, that analysis showed no differences attributable to power source in the situation ( i.e., inherited monetary resources vs. perceived financial knowledge ). Finally, we found no significant differences attributable to current relationship status or to the basis of their responses ( e.g., current or previous relationship ) among the students'responses to the dependent measures. Therefore, we grouped the participants according to power extent and gender and proceeded with the study's primary analyses.   Responsibility for Causing the Argument   We predicted that power extent and gender would affect respondents'attributions concerning which partner was responsible for causing the disagreement in the story. Specifically, Hypotheses 1a and 1b suggested that power extent influences perceptions of who is more responsible for causing the argument ; furthermore, Hypothesis 2 suggested differential influences of power extent on women and men.

Subsequent separate tests demonstrated that the three-way interaction occurred only with the item assessing partner's responsibility for causing the argument, F(1,148) = 7.285, p =.008, h 2 =.047. Although women's and men's causal attributions of their partner's responsibility differed, those patterns were influenced by the type of power in the situation ( inherited monetary resources or perceived financial knowledge ) and power extent ( Figure 1a and 1b ). We predicted no specific between-cell differences. However, according to subsequent Duncan multiple range tests comparing the means at p <.05 ( Norusis, 1998 ), the men assigned to the lower power condition attributed less causal responsibility to their partner with inherited monetary resources ( M = 2.89, SD = 0.96 ) than to [MASK_NOLOSS], SD = 1.00 ; see\",\n",

Overall, the men's patterns of attributions for their partner's responsibility supported both alternative hypotheses ( 1a and 1b ) concerning the influence of power extent on men's causal responsibility attributions. However, the direction of their causal responsibility attributions was dependent on the source of power. When the power source in the situation was inherited monetary resources, the men demonstrated a pattern in which they viewed the partner without resource power as more responsible. Specifically, when the men themselves had the inherited monetary resources, they tended to attribute more responsibility to their partner ( M = 3.40, SD = 0.99 ) than they did when their hypothetical partner had that situational power ( M = 2.89, SD = 0.96 ).

According to the patterns just described, men's causal responsibility attributions were influenced both by their power in the situation and by the source of that power. If the power source was inherited monetary resources, then the men appeared to attribute causal responsibility to the person with less power in the situation ( Hypothesis 1a, or JRB ).

( n11 )   The difficulty in pinpointing the etiology of sudden hypoacusis has hindered efforts to treat it. ( n12 ) Many treatment protocols have been proposed by various authors. Among the variety of drug therapies that have been used are vasodilators ( e.g., carbogen, alpha blockers [MASK_NOLOSS] cochlear tissues, ( n13-n16 ) corticosteroids to counteract a possible autoimmune mechanism and to exert antiphlogistic and antiedematogenic effects, ( n10, n17 ) and osmotic drugs ( e.g., mannitol ) to modify the hydrostatic pressure of the perilymph and increase the amount of blood in the cochlea by creating an osmotic gradient between plasma and perilymph. ( n10, n18-n21 ) The use of dextran has also been suggested as a means of creating a hypervolemic hemodilution, thus causing a decrease in blood viscosity and an increase in cochlear blood flow. ( n22-n24 ) Some authors have employed normovolemic hemodilution to produce a decrease in hematocrit without reducing volemia.

A histologic diagnosis of malignant fibrous histiocytoma was made, and the patient underwent wide local excision and neck dissection followed by postoperative radiation therapy. We briefly discuss the characteristics and treatment of this rare entity. Introduction   Malignant fibrous histiocytomas -- first described by O'Brien and Stout in 1964 -- are high-grade, pleomorphic, soft-tissue sarcomas. ( n1 ) They are primarily made up of spindle cells arranged in a storiform pattern and admixed with histiocyte-like cells. Because of the dichotomous distribution of cells in these tumors, there is controversy over their histogenesis. Recent immunohistochemical studies suggest that the basic cell is the fibroblast or myofibroblast and that histiocytic differentiation is either variable or absent. ( n2 ) The pleomorphic cell type and the broad histologic appearance, which can include myxoid or hemangiocytomatous features, make the pathologic identification of these tumors difficult and require that they be differentiated from other sarcomas that have a pleomorphic appearance.   Malignant [MASK_NOLOSS] tumors are relatively rare in the head and neck region, accounting for only 1 to 3% of all cases of malignant fibrous histiocyroma.

Computed tomography ( CT ) demonstrated a multilobulated and uniformly enhancing soft-tissue [MASK_NOLOSS] of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle ; it abutted but did not infiltrate the muscles forming the floor of the right posterior triangle ( figure 1 ). Biopsy examination revealed that it was a malignant fibrous histiocytoma. CT of the chest was negative for pulmonary metastasis.   The patient was taken to the operating room for wide excision of the mass, including resection of the floor of the neck musculature and neck dissection of levels II, III, and V ; the sternocleidomastoid muscle and spinal accessory nerve were sacrificed. The pathology report noted an area suspicious for a positive margin, and the patient underwent further resection of the area ; subsequent pathologic examination failed to find any residual tumor. The patient recovered well and was referred for postoperative radiotherapy.   Microscopically, the mass contained spindle cells arranged in a storiform pattern. In addition, multinucleated, histiocyte-like cells were found interspersed between the spindle cells ( figure 2 ). Mitotic activity was prominent, and small areas of necrosis were noted.

The histologic diagnosis of malignant fibrous histiocytoma of the head and neck can be challenging, especially with small biopsy specimens ( multiple biopsies are sometimes required ). In some instances, the diagnosis can be established with confidence only when the entire tumor has been excised and thoroughly examined. Diagnosis requires an adequate biopsy for electron microscopy and special stains.   Farhood et al reviewed 176 cases of soft-tissue sarcoma of the head and neck that had been treated at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City between 1950 and 1985 and identified only seven cases of malignant fibrous histiocytoma. ( n8 ) They believed that limited biopsy material, such as that obtained from tissue core or needle aspirate, should not be regarded as optimal for making a definitive diagnosis of primary soft-tissue tumors. In their series, all patients had undergone a formal tissue biopsy prior to definitive treatment. This was also our experience ; two previous fine-needle aspirations in our patient had failed to provide a definitive diagnosis. We were able to arrive at a diagnosis of [MASK_NOLOSS] Differential diagnosis. At least nine entities should be considered in the differential diagnosis. They include atypical fibroxanthoma, spindle-cell carcinoma, amelanotic malignant mucosal melanoma, osteosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma, pleomorphic liposarcoma, dedifferentiated sarcomas, and glioblastoma multiforme. ( n5 )   Treatment. The rarity of malignant fibrous histiocytoma has precluded any one individual from acquiring sufficient experience to reach any meaningful conclusions regarding the most appropriate therapy. However, as with sarcomas at other sites, surgical excision of tumors in the head and neck region remains the definitive treatment. The extent and adequacy of excision will largely determine the incidence of local recurrence and survival. Extracapsular enucleation of the tumor will result in up to a 90% local recurrence rate because of the presence of microscopic pseudopodia, which tend to grow through the pseudocapsule. According to Weber et al, a positive surgical margin is the single most important factor leading to local failure. ( n9 ) Thus, wide excision\",\n",

The lesion was skin-colored and slightly mobile, and it featured an area of central concavity. The nasal cavity was uninvolved, and no cervical adenopathy was palpable. The remainder of the examination was normal. Computed tomography ( CT ) revealed the presence of a soft tissue mass with no bone involvement ( figure 1 ). An incisional biopsy was suspicious for a fibrohistiocytic neoplasm. An elective excision was planned.   The patient underwent a wide local excision of the tumor with local advancement flap closure. Histologic evaluation with hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed a spindle-cell-type malignancy that originated in the dermis and extended down into the subcutaneous fat and muscle ( figure 2 ). All surgical margins were negative. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for both [MASK_NOLOSS] but negative for cytokeratin ( figure 3 ). The final pathologic diagnosis was a cutaneous leiomyosarcoma of the nodular type and of an intermediate grade.

Clinical examination suggested that the patient had a T-cell lymphoma, a suspicion that was confirmed on immunohistochemical analysis. The patient was treated with combination chemo- and radiotherapy and exhibited a marked response. At the 14-month followup, he remained disease-free. Introduction   Nasal T-cell lymphomas are aggressive, locally destructive midfacial necrotizing lesions. It is now recognized that the vast majority of cases of lethal midline granuloma represent nasal T-cell lymphomas. ( n1, n5 ) In this article, we describe one such case in an elderly man, and we briefly review some of the more salient features of the diagnosis of this disease. Case report   A white 73-year-old man was evaluated at an outside institution for an 18-month history of nasal obstruction and chronic rhinorrhea. He was found to have nasal polyposis and a septal perforation, and he underwent endoscopic sinus surgery with polypectomy and septal button placement. Postoperatively, he failed to improve. He exhibited extensive [MASK_NOLOSS]. Results of biopsy analysis of the involved nasal mucosa were inconclusive. He was referred to us for further evaluation.   Our examination revealed an extensive amount of friable, granular tissue along the floor of the nose and lateral nasal wall bilaterally ( figure 1 ). A large septal perforation encompassed the anterior half of the septum. A fistula tract extended from the floor of the nose to the gingivobuccal sulcus under the upper lip, and there was a separate midline ulcer of the hard palate ( figure 2 ).   Biopsy specimens taken from the intranasal and sublabial margins of the fistula were consistent with nasal T-cell lymphoma. Microscopic examination revealed a dense lymphocytic infiltrate, dissection of collagen bundles, and angioinvasion.

The patient developed osteoradionecrosis of the hard palate at the site of his previous ulceration because of inadequate soft-tissue coverage ( figure 4 ). There was no evidence of local recurrence or residual disease. Discussion   Nonspecific nasal symptoms often predate the appearance of mucosal ulceration and tissue necrosis by 1 year or more. ( n6, n7 ) The ambiguous nature of these symptoms can result in a delay in diagnosis. The initial symptom in most cases is nasal obstruction ; purulent rhinorrhea is the second most common sign. ( n3, n6, n7 ) The nasal mucosa is usually pale, friable, and granular and is often accompanied by purulence or crusting.

Even so, death from this disease occurs in 50% of patients as a result of distant extranodal spread or relapses that occur outside the treatment field.

Ulcerations of the heel also frequently lead to infection and osteomyelitis of the calcaneus ( 12, 13 ).   Several alternative hypotheses exist for the etiology of pressure ulcers, as described by various authors with relevant data. In addition to nominal pressure [MASK_NOLOSS] have included the nutritional state of the person, metabolic activities, weight, degree of general health, age, the presence of incontinence, moisture, heat, skin surface and subsurface friction, mechanical shear, tissue mobility, presence of infection, neurological damage, and pressure duration ( 5, 7, 14-17 ). Krouskop ( 18 ) proposed a model for pressure ulcers based on tissue necrosis initiated by cell-to-cell contact. It is theorized that the cell-to-cell contact occurs when interstitial fluid is disrupted because of an alteration in the capability of the tissue to distribute and support the load. Kosiak ( 1, 19 ) studied the response of skin to mechanical stress and proposed a pressure-duration relationship for skin breakdown. Daniel ( 20 ) found that the initial pathologic changes are seen in muscle tissue when swine are subjected to pressure conditions. As the pressure is increased, or the duration of the pressure is increased, changes are seen in the skin. Several variables can affect the pressure-duration relationship including moisture, shear, nutrition [MASK_NOLOSS] on the type of mechanical load and duration of the load ( 21, 22 ).   Several investigators have sought to assess the effects of mechanical stress on skin and tissue using animal models ( 19, 20, 23-29 ). Sanders et al. ( 21 ) reviewed the literature, evaluating the response of skin to mechanical stress, and concluded that skin structures adapt and these adaptations depend on the mechanical load direction, duration, and intensity. Goldstein and Sanders ( 22 ) used pigs as a model to evaluate adaptation of skin to normal and shear forces and found that tissue adaptation occurred.   Collagen remodeling occurs in normal skin, as a response to stresses and during wound healing ( 21, 30, 31 ). As a result of chronic disease and disability, abnormal loading may occur as a result of paralysis, decreased sensation, and prolonged bedrest or sitting ( 21 ).

Dermal Components   Minimal Response : preservation of the initial vascular components with easy determination of lumenal outlines, maintenance of original fiber bundle orientation and staining quality, and identification of elastic fiber grouping using special staining.   Maximum Response : sufficient compression of small blood vessels to obscure lumenal diameters, concurrent compression of fiber bundle components as revealed by opaque staining, and poor delineation of elastic fibers and/or interruption of grouping. RESULTS Histomorphology of Control Test Sites   The human foreskin tissue site tested is composed of fibroelastic tissue, which is surfaced by orthokeratinized stratified squamous epithelium. The surface has an undulating configuration, a feature resulting from the presence of [MASK_NOLOSS] that resemble papillomatous folds. The outer orthokeratin, which surfaces the epithelium, is firmly adherent following sectioning. There is a vividly staining stratum granulosum rich in keratohyaline granules. The deeper stratum spinosum has a highly variable thickness that, in some areas, ranges from five to eight cell layers. Thicknesses of three to five cells predominate. Within the stratum spinosum, individual cells have indistinct cytoplasmic boundaries without prominent cell membrane detail. The nuclei are ovoid basophilic structures, often bordered by narrow clear zones of cytoplasm. Nucleoli are faint and vary from one to three in number. The basal layer nuclei have dense basophilia, and this deepest layer of epidermis is a sharp delineation from the overlying stratum spinosum. The stratum basalis has a one- to four-cell layer thickness. Mitotic division is rare. Many specimens demonstrate basal layer cells with an ovoid shape and cytoplasm with melanin granules. Some ridges are \" saw toothed, \" while others are blunted and fused. Still others are flat. Flattened ridges are often associated with [MASK_NOLOSS] The basement membrane zone is narrow and indistinct and is delineated only by a broad amorphous band of staining. The underlying connective tissue is intermediate between loose and dense, therefore designated as \" moderately dense. \" Fiber bundles are best characterized in modified Masson stained sections and appeared short with indistinct cytoplasmic boundaries. Scattered nuclei have both blunted and stellate forms. The connective tissue has lesser density within the dermal papillae.

       " '[YEAR:2002] converse question : how is it that when stress is [MASK_NOLOSS] When resources are plentiful, why should the metabolism be trying less hard to forestall death?   Experiments in caloric restriction ( CR ) are a challenge for any of the \" tradeoff \" theories of aging, but the disposable soma theory is particularly vulnerable, exactly because it is premised on a tight calorie budget. The essence of the theory is that there\\'s never enough food energy to do a perfect job of everything, so the body\\'s allocation for repair and maintenance will always be shortchanged. How can the theory accommodate the fact that when energy is least available, repair and maintenance are at their most efficient -- even as expenditures for activity and for immune function are also at their peak?   The second source of evidence that aging is an adaptation -- a deliberate \" creation \" of natural selection -- comes from ewly discovered data on the universality of aging mechanisms. Bacteria and algae don\\'t age because their life cycle is so primitive that there is nothing to distinguish young from old cells. Higher [MASK_NOLOSS] aging, however. Much larger than bacteria, single-celled protists are distinguished by a more complex metabolism and DNA that is concentrated in a nucleus. Protists carry the mother of all aging mechanisms : a replication counter that will kill a cell line after it has procreated a fixed number of times. The tally is maintained in a repetitive tail on the end of every DNA strand, called the telomere. The DNA replication that takes place whenever a cell divides omits a stretch of that tail, and the chromosome becomes shorter with each cell division. The telomere is a buffer zone, completely expendable, so for awhile the shortening has no effect on the generational cells\\'viability. But eventually the telomere is used up, the chromosome\\'s integrity is in danger, and the cell, in fact, refuses to replicate.   One curious thing about this process is that it appears to be entirely avoidable. All eukaryotes ( cells with a nucleus, including protists and all animals and plants ) carry the gene for [MASK_NOLOSS], the entire chromosome is faithfully replicated, and the tail doesn\\'t lose any length. A bit of reflection makes it clear that this capability is absolutely essential to the long-term continuity of life. But in replication of protist cells, the gene for telomerase is silenced just as it is needed most ; instead, the telomeres are permitted to shrink with each replication. They are only replenished when the protist is joined',\n",
       " '[YEAR:2002]Thermal motion combined with input energy gives rise to a channeling of chance that can be used to exercise control over microscopic systems.   A great challenge for the burgeoning field of nanotechnology is the design and construction of microscopic motors that can use input energy to drive directed motion in the face of inescapable thermal and other noise. Driving such motion is what protein motors -- perfected over the course of millions of years by evolution -- do in every cell in our bodies. ( n1 )   To put the magnitude of the thermal noise in perspective, consider that the chemical power available to a typical molecular motor, which consumes around 100-1000 molecules of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) per second, is 10 -16 to 10 -17 W. In comparison, a molecular motor moving through water exchanges about 4 x 10 -21 J ( the thermal energy kT at room temperature ) with its environment in a thermal relaxation time of order 10 -13 s. Thus, a thermal noise power of about 10 -8 W continually washes back and forth over the molecule. That power, which, [MASK_NOLOSS] harnessed to perform work, is 8-9 orders of magnitude greater than the power available to drive directed motion. For molecules, moving in a straight line would seem to be as difficult as walking in a hurricane is for us. Nonetheless, molecular motors are able to move, and with almost deterministic precision.   Inspired by the fascinating mechanism by which proteins move in the face of thermal noise, many physicists are working to understand molecular motors at a mesoscopic scale. An important insight from this work is that, in some cases, thermal noise can assist directed motion by providing a mechanism for overcoming energy barriers. In those cases, one speaks of \" Brownian motors. \" ( n2 ) In this article, we focus on several examples that bring out some prominent underlying physical concepts that have emerged. But first we note that poets, too, have been fascinated by noise ; see box 1. Bivalves, bacteria, and biomotors   Bacteria live in a world in which they are subject to viscous [MASK_NOLOSS] characters can not be converted in ASCII text ) in Newton\\'s equation of motion can be safely ignored.

       " '[YEAR:2002]1a ( Avonex ). 8 Some investigators have suggested that different treatment effects measured by the EDSS in these clinical trials reflect fundamental differences in the cohorts of patients. 6 For example, patients in the European trial were, on average, younger and less likely to be free of exacerbations for 2 years before study enrolment than those in the other trials. These differences suggest that the effects of interferon beta as measured by the EDSS are most easily demonstrated early in the secondary progressive phase when exacerbations are commonly superimposed on gradual progression of disability. Consistent with this interpretation, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence in the UK recommended withdrawal of approval for interferon beta- 1b, then the only approved treatment for [MASK_NOLOSS]   Mitoxantrone is an anthrecenedione used to treat various malignant disorders. 10 Several immunosuppressant properties of this drug provide a rationale for its use in multiple sclerosis, which is associated with dysregulated responses of T and B cells to antigens in the central nervous system and macrophage-mediated myelin damage and axonal injury. 1 Mitoxantrone inhibits T-cell activation, abrogates proliferation of B and T cells, diminishes antibody production, and deactivates macrophages. 11-13 Mitoxantrone also effectively suppresses experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in rodents, an animal model of multiple sclerosis. 14, 15   Several pilot trials of mitoxantrone were effective and showed no adverse events. 16-19   The encouraging results and tolerability during pilot studies of mitoxantrone prompted this placebocontrolled, double-blind, randomised, multicentre, phase III trial of mitoxantrone in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis ( the MIMS study ).

We then examined in-situ islets from two healthy pancreases and two batches of isolated islets for the presence of TF by electron microscopy with the immunogold technique ( figure 4 ). Ultrastructurally, the endocrine cells in all the examined islets were well preserved, although the contrast in the intracellular structures was not optimum because the tissues had not been treated with osmium. In pancreatic islets in situ and isolated islets, gold particles showed the presence of TF in both a and cells, localised to the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi stacks and transitory vesicles budding from the trans-Golgi stacks, and the secretory granules. TF was detected at a moderate concentration in the -cell granules, particularly in the core, but at a higher concentration and randomly distributed throughout the matrix of the a-cell granules. We saw no TF immunoreactivity in the d or pancreatic polypeptide cells, and all negative control labelling experiments were negative.

Thus, TF activity is apparently associated with a high-molecular-weight fraction ; since TF is a membrane-bound protein with a transmembrane region, 4 the protein is likely to be associated with micro particles. Incubation of human islets of Langerhans with fresh human plasma that had no additives induced gelation ( as monitored by viscosimetry ) after about 9.5 min, whereas the buffer alone induced no clotting after 60 min ; thus, the islets were able to induce coagulation activation ( n=7 ; not shown ).

Increases in blood pressure seen upon cessation of ENO can not be interpreted from the available data. But even a lowering of blood pressure would not per se imply an adverse effect of ENO because oxygen saturation remained stable in our patients, and more generally, blood pressure is not a good measure of oxygen delivery.   The median methaemoglobin concentration was 1.9% : ( 25th and 75th percentile 1.65 and 2.3% ). Even the mean value of 3.2%, which reflects one baby with multiorgan failure, does not constitute toxicity. Moreover, ENOinduced methaemoglobinaemia has a mechanistic basis distinct from that of inhaled nitric oxide. Whereas nitric oxide is scavenged by haemes of oxygenated haemoglobin to [MASK_NOLOSS] and thus haemoglobin does not eliminate its bioactivity. Methaemoglobinaemia may even be a surrogate biomarker of oxygen delivery in the case of ENO, and thus necessitate a rethinking about desired concentrations of methaemoglobin ( unpublished observations ).   A fundamental issue in the care of patients with critical hypoxaemia is the weak relation between partial pressure of oxygen ( reflected in the arterial/alveolar ratio of oxygen partial pressure ) and delivery of oxygen to tissues. It is, therefore, not surprising that improvements in partial pressure of arterial oxygen -- from nitric oxide, oxygen, positional manoeuvres, or blood-pressure-altering agents -- have had limited prognostic value. The main determinant of oxygen delivery is blood flow in the microcirculation, which is precisely controlled through red-blood-cell processing of nitric oxide bioactivity to subserve hypoxic vasodilation and hyperoxic vasoconstriction. 1, 2 Thus, it will be informative to find out the effects of therapeutic agents on this mechanism, and, more generally, whether the nitric oxide content of red blood cells provides a useful measure of oxygen delivery.

Discussion   Our results show an increased risk of death from liver disease in persons infected with either HIV-1 or HBV, but this risk was highest in men coinfected with both viruses. Rates of liver-related deaths were higher in men with the lowest CD4 nadir and seemed to increase after 1996, when HAART was introduced. These findings suggest that although HAART is effective against HIV-1, identification and comprehensive management of individuals coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV is important, [MASK_NOLOSS] risk of liver-related mortality in HBsAg positive men infected with HIV-1 was notable, but the explanation for this observation is not clear. HIV-1 may destroy CD4+ lymphocytes that are activated to combat HBV infection. However, it is not clear how depletion of CD4+ lymphocytes would directly enhance hepatic fibrosis, which has been linked with a more vigorous cytotoxic T-cell response. 25 CD4 depletion could alter the intrahepatic cytokine milieu, contributing to increased fibrosis. 26 Depletion of CD4 cells is also associated with liver injury from other causes, such as opportunistic infections or hepatotoxicity of drugs used for prophylaxis or treatment of such infections. HIV-1 infection also affects the immune system in many other ways that could directly or indirectly enhance liver fibrosis from HBV, as has been previously 10, 11 reported for HCV infection.   The trend toward increased risk of death related to liver disease in HIV-1-HBV coinfected men noted after 1996 has several possible explanations. First, toxicity from antiretroviral medications could explain these findings ; an increased frequency of hepatitis from HAART has been reported [MASK_NOLOSS], stopping treatment with lamivudine can exacerbate HBV-related liver disease. 28 Our analysis did not indicate that this factor contributed to mortality, but only a small number of men had sufficient data to assess this possibility. Third, the increase could be due to the longer duration of HBV infection by the advent of HAART. Fourth, immune responses restored by HAART might actually exacerbate progression of HBV infection, as has been reported for tuberculosis and cytomegalovirus infections. 29 Such exacerbations of HBV infections also arise after chemotherapy or after cessation of treatment with steroid. 30 Although episodes of hepatitis have been reported in association with enhanced immune responses to HBV ( clearance of hepatitis B e antigen HBeAg ), 31',\n",
       " \"[YEAR:2002] tumors -- specifically, those of the oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx, maxillary sinus, and lacrimal glands, but not of the cervical lymph nodes -- have lacked the lymphoid component. ( n5 ) Therefore, it would be more appropriate to call them oncocytic papillary cystadenomas. The histologic features of both the parotid and nasopharyngeal lesions in our patient satisfied these criteria and justified our diagnosis of Warthin's tumor.   The histogenesis of Warthin's tumor in the parotid gland is controversial. It is most widely believed that parotid Warthin's tumor arises from ectopic salivary duct epithelium that has become trapped in the intraparotid lymph nodes during ontogeny. Encapsulation of the parotid gland occurs late in ontogeny, and the gland develops in a loose arrangement and with intermingling of lymphoid tissue. It [MASK_NOLOSS] reserve cells or in differentiated duct cells that have undergone anaplasia ( dedifferentiation ). It is also possible that the origin of the lymphocytic component is the result of an immunologic reaction to the epithelial component rather than a representation of normal non-neoplastic lymphoid tissue. ( n5 ) The immunologic theory is supported by the findings of a predominance of B lymphocytes in a pattern that is similar to that seen in reactive hyperplasia. ( n6, n7 ) However, other investigators have found a predominance of T cells and have observed patterns that are similar to that of normal lymphoreticular tissue. ( n8, n9 )   To explain the apparently paradoxical immunologic findings in Warthin's tumor, Griffiths and Dekker suggested that the cell type represents different stages in the evolution of Warthin's tumor. ( n3 ) They theorized that the initial oncocytic metaplasia in Warthin's tumor induces an early T-cell response that over time recruits a much larger B-cell population.   Yeh et al ( n2 ) and others believe that Warthin's tumor of the nasopharynx originates in components of [MASK_NOLOSS] lymphoid stroma. Chronic inflammation in the nasopharynx induces the formation of oncocytic metaplasia of the glandular tissues in the stroma.

( n4 ) On the other hand, Griffiths and Dekker believe that the lymphoid component of nasopharyngeal Warthin's tumor is unlikely to represent indigenous lymphoid tissue but rather an immune response. ( n3 )   A Warthin's tumor in the nasopharynx is in itself rare. It follows, then, that a simultaneous Warthin's tumor in the parotid gland is even rarer. Although it is possible that the appearance of these two tumors in our patient was coincidental, it is interesting to consider a possible association.   First, it is known that nasopharyngeal carcinoma can metastasize to the parotid gland, particularly on the ipsilateral side. ( n10 ) Is it possible that the parotid Warthin's tumor in our patient represented an ipsilateral metastasis from the nasopharynx? Not likely, given that almost all Warthin's tumors are benign. Even those few extraparotid Warthin's tumors that are occasionally found in the vicinity of the parotid have [MASK_NOLOSS], Warthin's tumors have been reported to undergo malignant transformation, which could lead to metastasis. ( n12 ) However, our patient had no histologic evidence of malignancy in either of her two tumors.   A second possibility is that one or more unknown systemic factors might have influenced the development of synchronous Warthin's tumors in our patient. This theory is more tenable than the first, given that oncocytic metaplasia has been considered to represent an early stage in the evolution of Warthin's tumors. ( n3 ) Oncocytic metaplastic changes, in turn, can occur secondary to systemic factors such as nutritional or metabolic deficiencies, genetic factors, environmental influences, duct obstruction, or chronic inflammation. ( n4 ) Therefore, it is possible that in our patient, salivary gland elements had been trapped in the lymphoid stroma in both the parotid gland and the nasopharynx during ontogeny. Later in life, one or more systemic factors might have led to the induction of oncocytic metaplasia in these trapped salivary elements, which might have led to the [MASK_NOLOSS] Figure 1.

We found that the most common probable causes for the failure of previous surgery were incomplete lowering of the facial ridge ( 94% of cases ), persistent sinodural-angle air-cell disease ( 92% ), persistent tegmental air-cell disease ( 88% ), recurrent or persistent cholesteatoma ( 66% ), persistent mastoid-tip air-cell disease ( 62% ), a small meatus ( 60% ), and persistent hypotympanic air-cell disease ( 56% ). After a mean postoperative follow-up of 26 months, we found no appreciable difference in success rates between patients who had undergone only one previous surgery ( 93% ) and those who had undergone more than one previous surgery ( 95% ) prior to referral to our center. Follow-up hearing data revealed a statistically significant improvement in air and bone conduction and a nonsignificant reduction in the air-bone gap. We conclude that revision mastoid surgery following multiple earlier surgical failures does not carry an appreciably higher risk of failure than does initial revision [MASK_NOLOSS] change in the causes of failure following mastoid surgery over the past 3 decades. Introduction   The goals of surgery for otitis media are universal and have been clearly articulated in the past. ( n1 ) The mandates for the surgeon include removal of disease ( e.g., infection and cholesteatoma ) in the middle ear and in the mastoid cavity as well as reconstruction of the area in a manner designed to minimize the risk of recurrent disease. It is also desirable to maximize hearing postoperatively and to avoid injury to important neurovascular structures.   The literature is replete with reports on the merits of the two major surgical procedures that address these problems : the canal-wall-down ( open-cavity ) techniques and the canal-wall-up ( closed-cavity ) techniques, with or without second-look surgery. ( n1-n4 ) What is sometimes overlooked in discussions of the various surgical approaches is the significant rate of failure or recidivism. ( n4 ) Failure might be the result of recurrent or persistent cholesteatoma or persistent infection and suppuration following surgery for chronic otitis media with or without cholesteatoma.

( n1-n4 ) The success of tympanomastoid surgery, therefore, has been defined as the attainment of a dry ear postoperatively. Various authors have reported success rates in the range of 70 to 95%. ( n4 ) A number of articles have identified a subset of surgical factors that serve as hallmarks of a classic \" problem cavity, \" or discharging mastoid bowl. ( n5, n6 ) The problem cavity is likely to exhibit a number of findings that are believed to be responsible for failure. ( n6 ) These findings include a small meatus, a high facial ridge, a persistent bony canal wall, a partially removed attic wall, a deep mastoid cavity, and a failure of a drum graft attributable to diseased mucosa and/or active mucopurulent drainage. ( n6 )   In 1974, Brandow delineated four major factors that he believed are responsible for continued cavity suppuration. ( n7 ) These factors are ( 1 ) a failure to completely eradicate the original disease, ( [MASK_NOLOSS], resulting in an accumulation of excessive debris, ( 3 ) persistence of an open eustachian tube, resulting in exposure of the middle ear mucosa, and ( 4 ) infection of the skin that lines the mastoid cavity.   In 1978, Cheesman analyzed the causes of surgical failure in 141 patients with chronic otitis media who later required revision surgery.

Nadol reported that revision surgery was successful in 85% of patients who had previously undergone one to three primary mastoid procedures.

Our goals were to ascertain the likely causes of the previous failures and to identify the sites of unexenterated air cells in the tympanomastoid cavity. We also compared our findings with those of similar studies conducted during the 1970s and 1980s to test the hypothesis that the causes of failure have not changed over the past 3 decades. Most important, we sought to determine if there was any difference in surgical outcomes ( i.e., dry ear vs draining ear ) between patients who underwent revision surgery for the first time and those who had undergone mastoid surgery after one or more failed revision attempts.

Only two complications of revision surgery were noted. One patient developed a postoperative wound infection that required intravenous antibiotics ; the infection subsequently resolved. Another patient developed a hematoma following tympanomastoid obliteration secondary to a rapid escalation of warfarin [MASK_NOLOSS] a muscle flap. There was no case of iatrogenic labyrinthine or facial nerve injury or iatrogenic postoperative sensorineural hearing loss. Discussion   Revision surgery for chronic otitis media is clearly a more complicated and potentially risky undertaking than is primary surgery. In this series, there was a 16% incidence ( 8 of 50 ears ) of significant complications noted upon referral to our clinic. These complications included profound sensorineural hearing loss in two ears, two cases of facial paralysis, and conditions related to the loss of dural integrity. Cottrell and Pulec found similar complications in 740 patients who had undergone radical or modified radical mastoidectomy at Mayo Clinic. ( n9 ) Management of these issues at the time of revision surgery was enhanced by routine preoperative computed tomography ( CT ). During our revision surgery, dural dehiscence ( 36% of cases ) and facial nerve vulnerability as a result of dehiscence ( 18% ) were common, and thus they should be anticipated.

Because any planktonic forms of bacteria that these patients have are rapidly killed by the antibiotic, treatment can lead to a symptomatic improvement even though the infection has not been eradicated.   Post reported that biofilms have been isolated on tympanostomy tubes taken from children. ( n2 ) Berry et al identified biofilms [MASK_NOLOSS] Berry et al made two other important observations :   -- A biofilm can be prevented by an ionic bombardment of the tube, presumably because this reverses the negative electrical charge in the glycocalyx.   -- The nature of a tympanostomy tube's surface might be a determining factor in whether a biofilm forms.   Tubes with certain coatings are more resistant to biofilms than are tubes with other coatings. For example, a silver nitrate coating does nothing to prevent a biofilm. The characteristics of a tube's surface are related to the initial attachment phase of the molecules that initiate biofilm development, and therefore they have some clinical significance. I do not believe it is a coincidence that post-tympanostomy tube otorrhea might play a part in the initiating event for many children with CSOM. Biofilms in CSOM   How are biofilms involved in CSOM? It could be that exposed osteitic bone is a good point for biofilm attachment. It could be that biofilms cause mucosal ulceration and bone erosion by attaching themselves to an altered cell membrane that [MASK_NOLOSS] that biofilms attach themselves to foreign bodies in the ear. Foreign bodies in the ear are not very common preoperatively, but they are postoperatively -- tympanostomy tubes being an obvious example. Other foreign bodies might include metal fragments of a suction tip that fall into the mastoid cavity during surgery. Finally, it could be that there are important cell-cell interactions, especially if those cells have been altered by viral infection.   What can we do about biofilms in patients with CSOM? There are several strategies that might someday be used to either interfere with biofilm formation or eradicate it once it has been established, including receptor blockade, the introduction of antipolymerases, and interference with biofilm messengers ( table ).   With regard to receptor blockade, it has been shown that treating mouse peritoneum with glycocalyx polysaccharides will prevent Bacteroides fragilis from forming a biofilm. The polysaccharide will occupy and block the B fragilis receptor sites so that the bacteria can not attach to them.   The introduction of antipolymerases\",\n",

The political question at hand is how to guide these powers'use. The issue divides into two sets of problems. One set concerns our choice among ends, given what we understand, however imprecisely, to be good. An example is the clash between health for some and life for others that we see in the stem-cell and therapeutic cloning controversies. However difficult such choices, we have grounds to make them. Most controversies about them follow familiar paths. Another example ( at least at first blush ) is genetic selection. The traits we might choose are good or not in terms that we grasp, see, and feel and to which we are attracted.   The second set of issues concerns our inadvertently ( or even intentionally ) changing the conditions under which we experience or strive for these goods and, therefore [MASK_NOLOSS] be in danger of denaturing the human good through misunderstanding complex interrelations, bad judgment, or even venality? We fear or ought to fear that we will distort what is good, destroying or weakening the conditions under which we grasp it and the phenomena that embody or lead us to it. One clear example of this is the way we might denature pride and spiritedness in the name of controlling anger and aggression. This issue goes beyond genetics and reaches also to questions of drug therapies, brain chemistry, and artificial intelligence. ( n1 )   The two sets of problems fit together. Both require that we think seriously about why things are good and the conditions under which what is good can be experienced and is attractive. We are moving into a period of literally trying to save the phenomena. A whole world of experience and desirability that in practice we once took for granted we no longer can take for granted.   In some ways, our need to think seriously about what is good arrives inauspiciously. [MASK_NOLOSS] understand form.

Meiosis produces haploid gametes from diploid parental cells. This process is unique to the germ cells of the gonads. Chromosome number is reduced during meiosis because the initial round of DNA replication is followed by two successive cycles of chromosome segregation. A meiosis-specific supramolecular proteinaceous structure, the synaptonemal complex, [MASK_NOLOSS] has a key role during meiosis. 2-4 In mammals, the synaptonemal complex consists of synaptonemal complex proteins ( SYCP or SCP ) 1, 2, and 3. 5-7 In mice, all three genes are expressed only in the testis and ovary and are considered to be germ-cell specific. 8   SYCP3 ( or SCP3 ) is a DNA-binding protein and a structural component of the synaptonemal complex, which mediates the SYNAPSIS or homologous pairing of chromosomes during meiosis of the germ cells. Male mice homozygous for the null mutation of the Sycp3 ( Scp3 ) gene are sterile as a result of massive apoptotic cell death in the testis during meiotic prophase. 9 In Sycp3-deficient male mice, axial or lateral elements and synaptonemal complexes are not formed. The chromosomes in the mutant spermatocytes do not synapse, and meiosis arrests. By contrast, heterozygous mutant males are fertile. Sycp3-deficient female mice are fertile and produce healthy offspring, although there is an increased risk of intrauterine death owing to the generation of aneuploid oocytes resulting from defective chromosomal segregation. 10   [MASK_NOLOSS] mice, we examined whether this protein is similarly required for human spermatogenesis. We identified the human SYCP3 gene on chromosome 12 and screened azoospermic men presenting with meiotic arrest and normal pregnancy-proven fertile controls for mutations in SYCP3.

       " '[YEAR:2003]Section : Articles Introduction   Background : Data on the short-term risk of disease progression in HIV-1-infected children are needed to address the question of when to begin combination antiretroviral therapy. We estimated 12-month risks of progression to AIDS and death, by age and most recent measurement of CD4 T-cell percentage ( CD4% ) or viral load, in children receiving no antiretroviral therapy or zidovudine monotherapy only.   Methods : We undertook a meta-analysis of individual longitudinal data for 3941 children from eight cohort studies and nine randomised trials in Europe and the USA. Estimates of risk were derived from parametric survival models.   Findings : 997 AIDS-defining events were recorded over 7297 person-years of follow-up in the analysis of CD4%, and 284 events over 2282 person-years in the viral load analysis, corresponding to 568 deaths ( 9087 person-years ) and 129 deaths ( 2816 person-years ), respectively. In children older than 2 years, risk of death increased sharply when CD4% was less than about 10%, or 15% for risk of AIDS, with a low and fairly stable risk at greater CD4%. Children younger than [MASK_NOLOSS] same CD4%. Risk of progression increased when viral load exceeded about 10 5copies per mL, although this association was more gradual compared with CD4%. Both markers had independent predictive value for disease progression ; CD4% was the stronger predictor.   Interpretation : This information is important for paediatricians making decisions, and for researchers designing trials, about when to initiate or restart antiretroviral therapy.   Reports from early cohort studies have shown that 20-25% of children infected with HIV-1 progress rapidly to AIDS or die during infancy, with slower disease progression in older children. 1 The introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy has resulted in major reductions in morbidity and mortality, 2, 3 but there have been no trials in either children or adults addressing the question of when such treatment should be started. In the absence of data, guidelines for starting and switching antiretroviral therapy have taken account of the CD4 T-cell count and HIV-1 RNA viral load as predictors of progression to symptomatic disease. 4-6 Although data about the prognostic value of these markers are available from studies [MASK_NOLOSS] immune system, slow attainment of a virological \" set point \", 7 clinical use of CD4 T-cell percentage ( CD4% ) rather than CD',\n",

However, because CD4 T cells and viral load are regularly monitored ( typically every 3 months ), short-term risk estimates are arguably clinically more relevant than long-term predictions. 12   Based on individual patient data from nearly 4000 HIV-1-infected children participating in cohort studies and randomised trials in Europe and the USA, who received no antiretroviral therapy or zidovudine monotherapy, we have estimated the 12-month risks of progression to AIDS and death, in terms of age and the most recent measurement of CD4% or viral load.

Records that matched on key demographic variables were linked to avoid duplication. This analysis was restricted to measurements before the start of antiretroviral therapy or during receipt of zidovudine monotherapy, which has a marginal clinical effect. 24 Thus, in the randomised trials of antiretroviral therapy, children allocated to combination antiret',\n",

On the basis of our data, we can not rule out the possibility that the MCP mutation identified is unrelated to HUS and indicates a coincidental finding of a rare genetic variant. However, this possibility is unlikely since the mutation is present in two of 25 patients with D-HUS, but in none of 100 healthy controls. Additionally, MCP has a main role in complement [MASK_NOLOSS] of HF1 and MCP could unveil precious information for a more tailored clinical management of patients with D-HUS. Treatment of D-HUS relies on plasma exchange or infusion, however 50% 18 to 75% 19 of patients, often small babies, progress to end-stage renal disease and need replacement therapy. One of the most debated issues is whether kidney transplantation is feasible in HUS. Children with Shiga-toxin associated HUS rarely progress to end-stage renal disease, but when they do so, transplantation often results in a good prognosis. 29Notably, graft outcome is less favourable in children 30 and adults 31 with D-HUS, with recurrences occurring in around 50% of patients and graft failure developing in all of them. Among patients with D-HUS and HF1 mutations, the recurrence range is 30-75%, according to different surveys. 18, 32 In patients of our registry, the five individuals with D-HUS and HF1 mutations who received a transplant had disease recurrence on the grafted kidney within a few weeks ( range 1 week to 6 months ) after surgery. 19 In view of the [MASK_NOLOSS] origin, indirect evidence suggests that a kidney transplant does not correct the HF1 genetic defect ( Noris M, unpublished ). To speculate that a dysfunction in MCP, which is a membrane-bound protein highly expressed in the kidney, can be corrected by transplanting a normal kidney, is tempting.

The overall response rate was 82.6 percent ( 100 out of 122 ).

With respect to definition of waste, 84 percent of the universities treat non-infectious human-cell-culture waste as biohazardous. Sharp items, including hypodermic needles, syringes with needles, and scalpel blades, are commonly treated ( by 85 percent of universities ) as biohazardous sharps regardless of contamination status.

It encompasses medical waste, which primarily comprises wastes potentially infectious to humans, as well as wastes from animal or plant research that are potentially infectious to those organisms or might alter their natural genetic-selection process. Research that generates biohazardous waste is commonly conducted at large research-oriented universities.   Management of the biohazardous waste stream in this environment is a challenge to the environmental health and safety ( EHS ) professional, who must consider multiple state and federal regulations and accreditation requirements ( Table 1 ).

       " '[YEAR:2003]Section : ORIGINAL ARTICLE Abstract   Giant-cell reparative granuloma ( GCRG ) is an unusual, non-neoplastic fibrous lesion that most often arises in the mandible and maxilla. GCRG of the temporal bone is exceedingly rare. To the best of our knowledge, only 17 cases have been previously reported in the international medical literature. Although no case of metastasis has been reported, this malignancy can be locally aggressive, and it often recurs following incomplete excision. We report the case of a young woman with a very large GCRG of the right temporal bone. We discuss the clinical picture, differential diagnosis, histologic evaluation, appearance on computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, and treatment options. We also review the cases of temporal bone GCRG that have been reported in the literature so far. Introduction   The term giant-cell reparative granuloma ( GCRG ) was introduced by Jaffe in 1953 to describe a lesion of the mandible and maxilla that occurred following a trauma-induced intraosseous hemorrhage.

The [MASK_NOLOSS] bone. The internal carotid artery, the facial nerve, and the mandibular nerve were ensheathed. During the operation, large portions of the temporal bone ( including the cochlea and the labyrinth ) and the temporomandibular joint ( including the articular disk, masseter, and medial pterygoid muscle ), parts of the temporal muscle, the greater wing of the sphenoid, the adventitia of the internal carotid artery, the maxillary artery, the mandibular nerve, parts of the temporal dura, and a small part of the caudal temporal lobe had to be resected. By performing such a radical operation, we were able to remove all tumor tissue as well as a margin of grossly uninvolved tissue. We were able to spare the facial nerve, and we treated it with a nerve stimulator at the completion of surgery. We reconstructed the dura with fascia lata and temporal muscle.

       " '[YEAR:2003] Jaffe wrote that the lesion represents a hyperplastic, reparative reaction to an intraosseous hemorrhage induced by trauma. ( n1 ) Many authors still share this opinion.

In fact, only 4 cases involved some previous trauma to the head. In one of those reports, the authors claimed that the lesion had occurred secondary to blunt trauma inflicted by a cricket bat. ( n19 ) However, the fact that this trauma had occurred only 6 weeks before the patient sought treatment for his tumor makes it most unlikely that the 3 x 2 x 1.5-cm GCRG had actually been caused by that particular trauma. Other causes that have been proposed include infections, ( n11 ) developmental anomalies, ( n17 ) and hormonal influences, ( n23 ) but no single theory has gained wide acceptance. ( n14 )   Differential diagnosis. The diagnosis of GCRG is based on the combination of clinical information, radiologic data, histopathologic characteristics, and response to treatment. ( n13 ) GCRG must be differentiated from the brown tumor of hyperparathyroidism, aneurysmal bone cyst, chondroblastoma, fibrous dysplasia, cherubism, osteosarcoma, and true giant-cell tumor.

We describe a case of pinneal inflammation that proved to be sarcoidosis, and we discuss the otolaryngologic manifestations of sarcoidosis. Introduction   Sarcoidosis is a common multisystem disorder of unknown etiology that can mimic disease processes such as polychondritis. ( n1 ) It can be self-limiting or progressive and relentless. Lesions are made up of noncaseating epithelioid and giant-cell granulomas.   Sarcoidosis can affect several organs and tissues, most commonly the hilar lymph nodes, eyes, skin, and mucosal surfaces. Otolaryngologists might encounter lesions that affect the nose, tonsils, larynx, trachea, nasopharynx, facial bones, and paranasal sinuses. ( n2, n3 ) The ear is an uncommon site, although involvement of the acoustic nerve manifesting as sensorineural deafness has been documented. ( n4 ) Moreover, sarcoidosis has been described at the site of earlobe piercings, usually in patients with systemic sarcoidosis. ( n5 ) Sarcoidosis with external ear manifestations is exceedingly rare, but it should be considered in the differential diagnosis [MASK_NOLOSS], we describe a case of pinneal sarcoidosis. Case report   A 38-year-old man came to the accident and emergency department of the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital in Dublin with an acute exacerbation of swelling of the right pinna, which had been present for 4 months. Initially the swelling was painless, but it had become acutely tender during the preceding week. No associated otologic symptoms were noted. The patient complained of feeling generally unwell, and he had noticed a significant weight loss over the preceding weeks.   Examination revealed that the helical cartilage and pinna on the right side was inflamed and thickened and that the overlying skin was erythematous and excoriated ( figure 1 ). The ENT examination was otherwise normal. A blood test revealed that the patient's serum angiotensin-converting enzyme ( ACE ) level was elevated, but other parameters were normal. Autoimmune antibody testing was negative.   A biopsy was performed, and histology of the specimen identified extensive noncaseating and coalescent granulomas that were made up of macrophages, giant [MASK_NOLOSS] sarcoidosis ( figure 2 ).\",\n",

( n4, n5 )   The largest subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases is the Eph family, which has 14 fully sequenced members. ( n6 ) The prototype of this gene family [MASK_NOLOSS] line. Initially, the ligands for these receptors were unknown, but they have since been identified. The Eph-family ligands are called ephrins ( for Eph receptor interacting proteins ). These ligands, like the receptors, are anchored on the plasma membrane via a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol linkage ( ephrin-A ) or a transmembrane domain ( ephrinB ). ( n7 ) The binding of ephrins to Ephs requires cell-to-cell contact ; soluble forms of ephrins can not activate their receptors. To date, eight ephrins have been cloned, and each is capable of binding to several receptors. ( n8 )   Both Ephs and ephrins are divided into two subclasses -- A and B -- on the basis of their sequence homology, structure, and binding affinity. Although initially characterized in the nervous system, ( n9 ) recent knock-out studies have suggested that ephrin-B2 and its EphB4 receptor play key roles in vascular development, ( n10 ) For example, mouse embryos that lack ephrin-B2 and EphB4 exhibit fatal defects in early angiogenic remodeling. Moreover, ephrin-B2 and [MASK_NOLOSS] with ephrin-B2 marking the endothelium of primordial arterial vessels while EphB4 marks the endothelium of primordial venous vessels. These distributions suggest that ephrin-B2 and EphB4 are involved in establishing arterial vs venous identity, perhaps by fusing arterial and venous vessels at their junctions. Defects in these processes might account for the early lethality observed in mouse embryos that lack these proteins. ( n9 )   EphB4 is also expressed on epithelial cells. Ectopic expression of EphB4 in the breast tissue of transgenic mice shows cooperative tumor induction and metastasis with neuT antigen. Preliminary studies have identified expression of the EphB4 gene in a number of human tumors, including hematologic malignancies, melanomas, glioblastomas, and lung, breast, and colon carcinomas.

Several studies have shown that a high expression of ephrins may be associated with an increased potential for tumorigenesis, including growth and metastasis. ( n10-14 ) Upregulation of ephrins during tumor progression is mediated by several mechanisms. The EphA2 receptor has been found in some tumor-associated endothelial cells. ( n19 ) Tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 1 -beta, which are produced by leukocytes, induce ephrin-A 1 in melanomas as host inflammatory responses to tumor. ( n10 ) Members of the Eph receptor gene family and their ligands facilitate cell-cell repulsion ( antiadhesive ) and promote cell migration. Overexpression of ephrin-B2 and EphB4 has been observed in malignant colonic epithelium. ( n14 )   Our study demonstrated overexpression of EphB4 in primary HNSCC and cervical lymph node metastases. Expression was greater in the metastatic lymph nodes than in the primary tumors, as evidenced by the greater intensity of immunofluorescence staining of EphB4 in the lymph nodes. Although our study did not demonstrate it, EphB4 may play a role [MASK_NOLOSS] We are currently investigating the quantitative differences in the expression of EphB4 with respect to tumor characteristics, induction of EGFRs, inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, and activation of oncogenes. We are also interested in defining the role that EphB4 plays in the development and metastasis of HNSCC. It is apparent that EphB4 can be used as a novel target for treatment delivery in refractory HNSCC. EphB4 inhibitors would be of therapeutic value if EphB4 can be proven to enhance tumor growth or spread.   Reprint requests : Parkash S.

       " '[YEAR:2003]Bacterial attachment to surfaces has been recognized for more than 50 years. By the 1970s, microbiologists became aware that probably most bacteria in nature exist as biofilms, even though most of the classic infectious disease doctrine has been based on the study of free-floating planktonic bacteria. In the simplest sense, biofilms are created when free-floating bacteria or fungi sense a surface, attach to it, and then elaborate chemical signals to coordinate differentiation and structure formation, including the development of a protective polysaccharide coating.   A major breakthrough in our understanding of biofilms occurred in the 1980s with the discovery of protein \" inducers \" that are responsible for \" quorum sensing? The 1990s witnessed an explosion of new knowledge about the genetics of cell-to-cell signaling and coordinated gene translocation for defense and virulence factors. ( n2 ) Possibly all prokaryotes are capable of cell-to-cell communication, and biofilm production has profound implications for human disease. Two public health examples are the original outbreak of Legionella pneumonia caused by biofilms on air-conditioning ducts and the outbreak of Pseudomonas infection caused by biofilms created during the production of albuterol ; [MASK_NOLOSS] 1990s. ( n3 ) Other biofilm-induced disease states include dental plaque and caries, catheter sepsis, bacterial endocarditis, and cystic fibrosis pneumonia. Specific otolaryngology disease states include tympanostomy tube otorrhea, bacterial colonization of tracheostomy tubes and voice prostheses, chronic middle ear effusion, and possibly chronic sinusitis. Cell-to-cell communication   Examples of coordinated bacterial behavior, such as the \" swarming \" movements of enteric bacteria, have been observed for almost 100 years. However, the notion that virtually all prokaryotes are capable of communication for enhanced survival is a truly revolutionary concept in our understanding of infectious disease. While studying the symbiotic relationship between Vibriofischeri bacteria within light organs and their host squid and fish, Engelbrecht and Silverman first began to unlock some of the mysteries of cell-to-cell signaling. ( n1 ) They noted that bioluminescence was triggered suddenly when bacterial numbers reached a certain threshold. They subsequently identified two quorum-sensing systems : luxI and luxR.

The luxI and luxR systems have been identified in almost all gram-negative bacteria, and cell-to-cell signaling molecules ( peptides ) have been identified in more than 30 species of gram-positive bacteria. The lux systems have been extensively studied in Pseudornonas spp and Escherichia coil, and they have been found to be necessary for both biofilm maturation and activation of numerous virulence factor genes. ( n4-n6 ) Presumably, the ability of pathogenic organisms to \" wait \" for a buildup of large numbers before releasing virulence factors confers a survival advantage by increasing the chances of overwhelming host defenses. ( n7 ) Biofilm formation, structure, and properties   In terms of human disease, biofilms tend to develop on inert surfaces ( e.g., tympanostomy tubes and ventriculoperitoneal shunts ), necrotic tissue ( as in temporal bone osteomyelitis ), or relatively ischemic normal tissue ( e.g, heart valve cartilage and bone ). Bacteria can sense a surface and form an active, [MASK_NOLOSS] Surface characteristics influence binding, and binding properties vary among species. For example, An and Friedman demonstrated that Pseudomonas spp bind relatively well to hydrophobic plastics ( e.g., polyethylene ), moderately well to hydrophilic metals, and poorly to hydrophilic substances that have a negative charge ( e.g., glass and oxidized plastics ). ( n8 )   Once a critical number of bacteria have formed a surface attachment, quorum sensing allows for specific differentiation and for production of an extracellular protective glycocalyx ( polysaccharide \" slime \" ). The biofilm assumes a physical structure and develops channels for diffusion of water and nutrients. Living in a more efficient \" societal \" structure allows for a reduction in the metabolic rate of individual cells.   In the host, biofilm provokes both cellular and humoral immune',\n",

Kass has [MASK_NOLOSS] and dangerous in its likely consequences... such a ban on human cloning will not harm the progress of basic genetic science and technology \" ( Kass, 2001 ). However many would contest that the use of embryonic stem cells is of paramount importance and should be endorsed for ongoing research. Jeffrey M. Drazen argues, \" it is reasonable to regulate the technology of somatic-cell nuclear transfer, just as we regulate the use of radioisotopes and recombinant DNA, but it is unreasonable to prohibit research using this technology \" ( Drazen, 2003 ). As the technology improves, there is a possibility to reprogram adult stem cells for therapeutic cloning without \" passing it thru \" the preimplantation embryo, thus negating current ethical challenges to such research. However the current legislation would unduly restrict this innovative technology. The role of \" Genetic Sociology \" could be to bridge the gap between the legislators and scientists to more clearly define the appropriate role of stem cell research in the field of regenerative medicine.

( n5 ) Heat sources include solar collectors operating up to 3000C or nuclear reactors designed to operate between 500C and 900C ( see the article by Gail Marcus and Alan Levin, PHYSICS TODAY, April 2002, page 54 ). More than 100 types of chemical cycles have been proposed, including systems based on zinc-oxygen operating at 1500C, sulfur-iodine at 850C, calcium-bromine at 750C, and copper-chlorine at 550C. At high temperatures, thermochemical cycles must deal with the tradeoff between favorable reaction kinetics and aggressive chemical corrosion of containment vessels. Separating the reaction products at high temperature is a second challenge : Unseparated mixtures of gases recombine if allowed to cool. But identifying effective membrane materials that selectively pass hydrogen, oxygen, water, hydrogen sulfate, or hydrogen [MASK_NOLOSS] problem. Dramatic improvements in catalysis could lower the operating temperature of thermochemical cycles, and thus reduce the need for high-temperature materials, without losing efficiency. Molecular-level challenges, with which researchers are fast making progress using nanoscale design, include accelerating the kinetics of reactions through catalysis, separating the products at high temperature, and directing products to the next reaction step.   Bio-inspired processes offer stunning opportunities to approach the hydrogen production problem anew. ( n6 ) The natural world began forming its own hydrogen economy 3 billion years ago, when it developed photosynthesis to convert COsub2, water, and sunlight into hydrogen and oxygen. Plants use hydrogen to manufacture the carbohydrates in their leaves and stalks, and emit oxygen to the atmosphere for animals to breathe. Single-cell organisms such as algae and many microbes produce hydrogen efficiently at ambient temperatures by molecular-level processes. These natural mechanisms for producing hydrogen involve elaborate protein structures that have only recently been partially solved. For billions of years, for instance, plants have used a catalyst based on manganese-oxygen [MASK_NOLOSS] process that frees protons and electrons. Likewise, bacteria use iron and nickel clusters as the active elements both for combining protons and electrons into Hsub2 and splitting Hsub2 into protons and electrons ( see figure 2 ). The hope is that researchers can capitalize on nature's efficient manufacturing processes by fully understanding molecular structures and functions and then imitating them using artificial materials in such applications as fuel-cell anodes and cathodes.

Figure 2. Nature has developed remarkably simple and efficient methods to split water andtransform Hsub2 into its component protons and electrons. The basic constituent of the catalyst that splits water during photosynthesis is cubane ( top ) -- clusters of manganese and oxygen. Researchers are only beginning to understand cubane's oxidation states using crystallography and spectroscopy ( see J.-Z. Wu et al., ref. 6 ). Bacteria use the iron-based cluster ( bottom, circled ) to catalyze the transformation of two protons and two electrons into Hsub2. The roles of this enzyme's complicated structural and electronic forms in the catalytic process can be imitated [MASK_NOLOSS] versions of these natural catalysts ( see F. Gloaguen et al. and J. Alper, ref. 6 ). Storing hydrogen   Storing hydrogen in a high-energy-density form that flexibly links its production and eventual use is a key element of the hydrogen economy. Unlike electricity, which must be produced and used at the same rate, stored hydrogen can be stockpiled for much later use, or used as ballast to bridge the differing temporal cycles of energy production and consumption.   The traditional storage options are conceptually simple -- cylinders of liquid and high-pressure gas. Industrial facilities and laboratories are already accustomed to handling hydrogen both ways. These options are viable for the stationary consumption of hydrogen in large plants that can accommodate large weights and volumes. Storage as liquid Hsub2 imposes severe energy costs because up to 40% of its energy content can be lost to liquefaction.   For transportation use, the on-board storage of hydrogen is a far more difficult challenge. Both weight and volume are at a premium, and sufficient fuel must be stored [MASK_NOLOSS] cars. ( n3 ) Figure 3 illustrates the challenge by showing the gravimetric and volumetric energy densities of fuels, including the container and apparatus needed for fuel handling. For hydrogen, that added weight is a major fraction of the total. For on-vehicle\",\n",

Hydrocarbons like methanol and octane are notable as high-volume-density hydrogen storage compounds as well as high-energy-density fuels, and cycles that allow the fossil fuels to release and recapture their hydrogen are already in use in stationary chemical processing plants. ( n7 )   Figure 4. The storage density of hydrogen in compressed gas, liquid, adsorbed monolayer, and selected chemical compounds is plotted as a function of the hydrogen mass fraction. [MASK_NOLOSS] greater than its liquid density at atmospheric pressure ; green data points on the right-hand side indicate liquid and gaseous Hsub2 densities. The straight lines indicate the total density of the storage medium, including hydrogen and host atoms. Of the inorganic materials ( plotted as triangles ), the compounds shown in boxes all form the alanate structure, composed of a tetrahedral, methanelike AIHsup-sub4or BHsup-sub4 anion and a metal cation. Those compounds are among the most promising hydrogen-storage fuel-cell materials. ( Adapted from L. Schlapbach and A. Zuttel, ref. 7. )   The two challenges for on-vehicle hydrogen storage and use are capacity and cycling performance under the accessible on-board conditions of 0-100C and 1-10 bars. To achieve high storage capacity at low weight requires strong chemical bonds between hydrogen and light-atom host materials in stable compounds, such as lithium borohydride ( LiBHsub4 ). But to achieve fast cycling at accessible conditions requires weak chemical bonds, fast kinetics, and short diffusion lengths, as might be found in surface adsorption. Thus, the high-capacity and [MASK_NOLOSS] compounds, such as metallic magnesium nitrogen hydride ( Mgsub2NHsub4 ) and ionic sodium borohydride ( Nasup+ ( BHsub4 ) sup- ), contain high volumetric hydrogen densities but require temperatures of 300C or more at I bar to release their Hsub2. Compounds with low-temperature capture and release behavior, such as lanthanum nickel hydride ( LaNisub5Hsub6 ), have low hydrogen-mass fractions and are thus heavy to carry.   Hydrogen absorption on surfaces is a potential route to fast cycling, but has been explored relatively little except for carbon substrates. Hydrogen can be adsorbed in molecular or atomic form on suitable surfaces, using pressure, temperature, or electrochemical potential to control its',\n",
       " '[YEAR:2004]als attraction. Each of the steps can be optimized in a specific nanoscale environment that includes appropriate catalysts, defects, and impurity atoms. By integrating the [MASK_NOLOSS] atoms are treated in one environment for dissociation, for example, and handed off to the next environment for diffusion, nanoscience engineers could simultaneously optimize all the desired properties. Another approach is to use three-dimensional solids with open structures, such as metal -- organic frameworks ( n8 ) in which hydrogen molecules or atoms can be adsorbed on internal surfaces. The metal atoms that form the vertices of such structures can be catalysts or dopants that facilitate the capture and release cycle. Designed nanoscale architectures offer unexplored options for effectively controlling reactivity and bonding to meet the desired storage requirements. Realizing the promise   A major attraction of hydrogen as a fuel is its natural compatibility with fuel cells. The higher efficiency of fuel cells -- currently 60% compared to 22% for gasoline or 45% for diesel internal combustion engines -- would dramatically improve the efficiency of future energy use. Coupling fuel cells to electric motors, which are more than 90% efficient, converts the chemical energy of hydrogen to mechanical work without heat as an intermediary. This attractive [MASK_NOLOSS] engines. The broad reach of that efficiency advantage is a strong driver for deploying hydrogen fuel cells widely.   Although fuel cells are more efficient, there are also good reasons for burning hydrogen in heat engines for transportation. Jet engines and internal combustion engines can be rather easily modified to run on hydrogen instead of hydrocarbons. Internal combustion engines run as much as 25% more efficiently on hydrogen compared to gasoline and produce no carbon emissions. The US and Russia have test-flown commercial airliners with jet engines modified to burn hydrogen. ( n9 ) Similarly, BMW, Ford, and Mazda are road-testing cars powered by hydrogen internal combustion engines that achieve a range of 300 kilometers, and networks of hydrogen filling stations are being implemented in some areas of the US, Europe, and Japan. Such cars and filling stations could provide an early start and a transitional bridge to hydrogen fuel-cell transportation.   The versatility of fuel cells makes them workable in nearly any application where electricity is useful. Stationary plants providing 200 kilowatts of neighborhood [MASK_NOLOSS] can connect to the electrical grid to share power but are independent of the grid in case of failure.

Fuel-cell power for consumer electronics like laptop computers, cell phones, digital cameras, and audio players provide more hours of operation than batteries at the same volume and weight. Although the cost per kilowatt is high for these small units, the unit cost can soon be within an acceptable consumer range. Electronics applications may be the first to widely reach the consumer market, establish public visibility, and advance the learning curve for hydrogen technology.   The large homogeneous transportation market offers enormous potential for hydrogen fuel cells to dramatically reduce fossil fuel use, lower harmful emissions, and improve energy efficiency. Fuel cells can be used not only in cars, trucks, and buses, but also can replace the diesel electric generators in locomotives and power all-electric ships. ( n8 ) Europe already has a demonstration fleet of 30 fuel-cell buses running regular routes in 10 cities, and Japan is poised to offer fuel-cell cars for sale [MASK_NOLOSS] be solved before hydrogen in fuel cells can compete with gasoline. ( n10 ) The heart of the fuel cell is the ionic conducting membrane that transmits protons or oxygen ions between electrodes while electrons go through an external load to do their electrical work, as shown in figure 5. Each of the half reactions at work in that circuit requires catalysts interacting with electrons, ions, and gases traveling in different media. Designing nanoscale architectures for these triple percolation networks that effectively coordinate the interaction of reactants with nanostructured catalysts is a major opportunity for improving fuel-cell performance. The trick is to get intimate contact of the three phases that coexist in the cell -- the incoming hydrogen or incoming oxygen gas phase, an electrolytic proton-conducting phase, and a metallic phase in which electrons flow into or from the external circuit ( see PHYSICS TODAY, July 2001, page 22 ).

There, oxygen combines with protons from the ion-exchange membrane and electrons from the external circuit to form water or steam. The energy conversion efficiency of the process can be 60% or higher.   A primary factor limiting proton-exchange-membrane ( PEM ) fuel-cell performance is the slow kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction at the cathode. Even with the best platinum-based catalysts, the sluggish reaction reduces the voltage output of the fuel cell from the ideal 1.23 V to 0.8 V or less when practical currents are drawn. This voltage reduction is known as the oxygen overpotential. The causes of the slow kinetics, and solutions for speeding up the reaction, are hidden in the complex reaction pathways and intermediate steps of the oxygen reduction reaction. It is now becoming possible to understand this reaction at the atomic level using sophisticated surface-structure and spectroscopy tools such as vibrational spectroscopies, scanning probe microscopy, x-ray diffraction and spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. ( n11, n12 ) [MASK_NOLOSS] reaction conditions, reveal the energetics, kinetics, and intermediates of the reaction pathway and their relation to the surface structure and composition of the reactants and catalysts. These powerful new experimental probes, combined with equally powerful and impressive computational quantum chemistry using density functional theory, ( n13 ) are opening a new chapter in atomic-level understanding of the catalytic process. The role of such key features as the atomic configuration of catalysts and their supports, and the electronic structure of surface-reconstructed atoms and adsorbed intermediate species, is within reach of fundamental understanding. These emerging and incisive experimental and theoretical tools make the field of nanoscale electrocatalysis ripe for rapid and comprehensive growth. The research is highly interdisciplinary, incorporating forefront elements of chemistry, physics, and materials science.

Bush and his Democratic opponent, Al Gore, focused on protecting Social Security, saving American education, expanding Medicare, raising or lowering taxes, and readying the military. If science was mentioned at all, it was usually in the context of missile defense, global warming, or Gore\\'s role in creating the internet.   With the exception of the debate over stem-cell research, science remains a background topic in the current campaign. Democratic candidate John Kerry has occasionally highlighted US science policy and used it against President Bush, charging that the administration has put politics and ideology ahead of science. \" Let scientists do science again, \" a headline on the Kerry election website says.   Bush has responded, primarily through his science adviser, John Marburger, by pointing to the 44% increase in federal R &D; since fiscal year 2001 and the record $132 billion in the administration\\'s FY 2005 R [MASK_NOLOSS] science investments, \" reads a headline on the Bush reelection website.

In an effort to get the candidates to specifically address questions of interest to the science community, PHYSICS TODAY has continued a tradition begun in 1976 ; it asked Bush and Kerry nine questions covering a range of science topics. Their answers, sometimes direct and sometimes vague, show fundamental differences on several key issues.   On missile defense, Bush says his request of $10 billion in FY 2005 for development and deployment of such a system fulfills a pledge he made to the American people. Kerry says we should not be \" falsely comforted by an untested and unproven defense system. \"   On global [MASK_NOLOSS] to deal with the problem.

But I will refocus our efforts on preventing the spread of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons and dramatically accelerating the security of nuclear weapons and material in Russia and around the world. We will not sit by, falsely comforted by an untested and unproven defense system, while these threats continue to fester.   2 Climate change : Virtually all reputable research in recent years has reinforced the scientific conclusion that global warming is a real and growing crisis caused, at least in part, by the burning of fossil fuels. Do you accept that scientific consensus? Under what circumstances would you regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions?   Bush Global climate change is a serious long-term issue. In 2001, I asked the National Academy of Sciences ( NAS ) to provide the most up-to-date information about the science of climate change. The academy found that considerable uncertainty remains about the effect of natural fluctuations on climate and the future effects climate change will have on our environment.   My administration is now well [MASK_NOLOSS] the science, expand the use of transformational energy and carbon sequestration technologies, and mitigate the growth of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States and in partnership with other nations. I created the new US Climate Change Science Program ( CCSP ) to refocus the federal government\\'s climate research programs, for which my 2005 budget seeks nearly $2 billion to fund research across the federal government. The NAS endorsed the CCSP strategic plan, noting that it \" articulates a guiding vision, is appropriately ambitious, and is broad in scope. \"   I also committed the nation to a goal of reducing American greenhouse gas intensity by 18% over the next 10 years, which would prevent more than 500 million tons of carbon emissions through 2012. To help achieve this goal, I created the Climate Vision program in 2003 to reduce the growth of greenhouse gas emissions by energy-intensive industrial sectors. Participants in the Climate Vision program account for between 40 and 45% of US greenhouse gas emissions.

And in my 2003 State of the Union address, I announced a $1.7 billion hydrogen fuel initiative to accelerate research that could lead to hydrogen-powered, no-emission vehicles within a generation.   Additionally, my administration is participating in robust international partnerships to promote clean, renewable, commercially available fusion energy and to construct the $1 billion FutureGen project, which will test the latest technologies to generate electricity, produce hydrogen, and sequester greenhouse gas emissions from coal.   Kerry I recognize the risk of climate change, and I have outlined a balanced set of programs that will have impact both in the near term and over the long term. My plan will also provide balanced support for technology that can increase the efficiency and cut greenhouse emissions in transportation systems, buildings, and industry that are [MASK_NOLOSS] encourage the use of renewable fuels such as ethanol and renewable electric generation that produce little or no net greenhouse gases. I will expand the production tax credit for wind and biomass energy to cover the full array of renewable energy sources and increase Department of Energy ( DOE ) research into renewable energy sources and their applications. And I will propose an aggressive program of research, standards, and incentives to accelerate electric generation from renewable energy. Clean coal technology can play a critical role, given technology to cut carbon dioxide emissions.   My plan would encourage energy efficiency with programs such as updated fuel efficiency standards, new tax incentives for automakers to build the new, more efficient automobiles of the future, and tax incentives for families to purchase more energy-efficient cars, trucks, and SUVs.   3 Science investment : There is concern in the science and economic communities that the US is losing its world leadership in the sciences, which they say bodes ill for future economic growth and global competitiveness.

Nevertheless, the No Child Left Behind Act, one of my proudest legislative achievements this term, is improving our schools and, consequently, the teaching of science.

We will continue to welcome international students and scientists while implementing balanced measures to end abuses of the student visa system. My administration has already achieved several notable successes in reducing delays now being experienced by some visa seekers. We have increased security while speeding up the clearance process ; approximately 1000 backlogged applications have already been cleared out.   Kerry For three years, the Bush administration has squandered America's leadership in the world, putting politics before science and doing nothing to create jobs while our workers fall further behind. The administration has proposed cuts for scientific research and grossly distorted and politicized science on issues from mercury pollution to stem-cell research. This approach not only limits the research that our scientists are doing today, it undermines important discoveries [MASK_NOLOSS]. I will reverse this course by restoring America's scientific leadership, helping find new cures, moderating healthcare costs, and developing new technologies that will create good jobs. I will boost support for the physical sciences and engineering by increasing research investments in agencies such as NSF, the National Institutes of Health, DOE, NIST, and NASA. This funding will help with the broad areas of science and technology that will provide the foundations for economic growth and prosperity in the 21st century. 4 Nuclear weapons : Does the US need to develop a new class of nuclear weapons to deal with the changing threats of the 21st century?

The data assume a 15% solar-cell efficiency, and 50% efficiency at the site of consumption.   Biomass energy production requires photosynthesis exclusively on fertile land, but it is another much discussed alternative energy. The US has about 1.6 million km ( 400 million acres ) of arable land that provides food for the current US population, with about 20% of the food left for export. The US is likely to progressively need that 20% in the next few decades as its population increases. Moreover, the current agricultural productivity depends on fossil fuels to provide the reactive nitrogen required to make fertilizer. Otherwise, about three to four times that [MASK_NOLOSS] provide photosynthetic nitrogen fixation to generate the current food supplies.   Quite apart from fertile land requirements, the solar-to-biomass conversion efficiency is very much smaller than for the conversion of solar to electrical energy. Modern agriculture can generate about 1-1.5 million kg of biomass vegetation per square kilometer of land with about 16 000 BTU per kg, for a total of about 0.06-0.09 Q on 4000 km of land. However, after accounting for external energy consumed through the agricultural process and the conversion of biomass to a useful fuel, the net energy production, if any, is less than 0.02 Q on 4000 km -- two orders of magnitude smaller than that of photovoltaic cell conversion. That is, biomass conversion would require some 100-fold more area of fertile land.   Wind energy is another secondary product of solar radiation.

In a recent analysis, Reuel Shinnar ( n10 ) of the City College of New York noted that the enormous effort to alter our infrastructure to create a hydrogen economy argues strongly for the direct automotive use of electricity itself, for which much of the infrastructure and potential technology are at hand. Energy science   Energy availability determines, drives, limits, and shapes the working capability of all processes of society. ( n11 ) The silent and plentiful gift of energy has fundamentally influenced the application of economic theory [MASK_NOLOSS] the educational system.   -- Economics. In the 1970s, Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen ( n12 ) tried to demonstrate the actual relationship between economics and thermodynamics, the basic physics of energy. He observed that most economists believe that \" the economic process can go on, even grow, without being continuously fed low entropy, \" which in a thermodynamics context means \" without receiving new energy. \" As we approach the limits of our easy access to energy, the defining economic currency will be dominated by availability of energy units rather than by an artificial currency, be that gold or dollars.   This change in economic theory is well illustrated by the silicon photovoltaic cells that brilliantly accomplished their mission in space flight in 1972 at an affordable economic cost. Yet, if they had to provide us with indispensable alternative energy, they would have had to operate continuously for at least 20 years just to replace the energy invested ( or consumed ) in their production. By 1999, photovoltaic cells were reported to produce their investment [MASK_NOLOSS] history illustrates the profound economic importance of the concept of net energy.

       " '[YEAR:2004]Section : FEATURES   Research studies have established the occurrence of adverse health effects in individuals exposed to organic dusts and water aerosols laden with endotoxin. To determine what exposure levels cause these health effects, it is necessary to quantify airborne endotoxin. Several scientific studies have demonstrated that the quantification of detectable endotoxin is affected by differences in sampling media, analytical method, and aerosol composition. The study reported here performed side-by-side endotoxin sampling using a liquid impinger, a glass fiber filter, and a polycarbonate filter in a wastewater treatment plant. Results show levels of detected endotoxin appear to be highest with the impinger. Coefficients of variation calculated for each sampling method show the glass fiber filter having the least variability when sampling was conducted at the highest endotoxin levels. Lastly, a Spearman rank order correlation test identified an apparent correlation between endotoxin levels obtained with the impinger and the glass fiber filter. Introduction   Endotoxin is a structural component found in the outer cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria. Various human cells have been found to respond to endotoxin. It appears, however, that [MASK_NOLOSS] cells of the immune system ( Ulmer, 1997 ). Some of the biologic responses associated with cellular reactions to endotoxin include fever induction, macrophage activation, B-cell mitogenicity, restrictive lung function changes, and reduction in alveolocapillary gas transfer ( Cotran, Kumar, &; Collins, 1999 ; Rylander, 1997 ).   Previous research studies have documented human exposure to endotoxin-containing dusts and aerosols. Several occupational studies have associated the presence of adverse health effects among agricultural workers exposed to organic dusts laden with endotoxin ( Clark, Rylander, &r; Larsson, 1983 ; Kennedy et al., 1987 ; Rylander, Haglind, &; Lundholm, 1985 ; Smid et al., 1994 ). Other studies have suggested that endotoxin-contaminated water aerosols, such as those generated during sewage treatment or atmospheric humidification, may be the source of upper respiratory and gastrointestinal disorders observed in an exposed population ( Khuder, Arthur, Bisesi, &; Schaub, 1988 ; Laitinen et al., 1994 ; Rylander, 1999 ; Milton, 1996 ; Teeuw, VandenbrouckeGrauls, [MASK_NOLOSS] airborne endotoxin is necessary for correlation of endotoxin levels with observed health effects.

This involved grafting the utricular mouse-derived progenitor cells into the developing ears ( otic vesicles ) of embryonic chickens. The results of these animal experiments corroborated the in vitro findings. The cells were successfully integrated into the developing chicken ear, and they gave rise to cells characteristic of hair cells. The success of this experiment was confirmed when the cells expressed immunologic markers indicative of hair cells.

Direct [MASK_NOLOSS] the drops come into direct contact with infected tissue. However, the external auditory canal might be so filled with desquamated epithelium, cerumen, and mucopurulence that medications can not effectively reach the target tissues. Therefore, if topical therapy is to be effective, these materials must be removed. This can be accomplished in the physician's office by mechanical removal or by gentle irrigation with 3% hydrogen peroxide at full or half strength.   Inflammation. Some medications have direct inflammatory effects. They include some antibiotics, as well as vehicles such as propylene glycol. Because inflammation is already part of the pathologic process, additional inflammation is an undesirable side effect that should be minimized or counteracted. The steroid component present in many preparations can serve this function.   Systemic effects. If a systemic effect is desirable, then, of course, the absence Of a systemic effect is a disadvantage. For example, if infection has spread beyond the external auditory canal and the middle ear, topical preparations will not be effective.

While fulminant hypersensitivity reactions are usually relatively easy to recognize, hypersensitivity may take a more subtle form. Oftentimes, the only manifestations of hypersensitivity are persistent erythema, edema, and otorrhea, which simply represent a failure of the ear to respond to therapy. In such circumstances, it may be impossible to distinguish between hypersensitivity reactions and clinical treatment failures. Advantages of ototopicals   By using a topical agent, the physician can deliver a concentration of medication that is several orders of magnitude higher than the concentration of a systemic agent. Topical delivery systems maximize the therapeutic ratio.

Moreover, the very high concentrations also make the emergence of resistant strains much less likely.   Ohyama et al measured the persistence of a single dose of topically applied 0.3% ofloxacin in otorrhea fluid, serum, and middle ear mucosa at various time intervals following administration.

Two tricks are necessary to make this work, he cautioned. The spray needs to be highly uniform. And the amount of spray must follow engine speed and load demands.   Achieving both conditions with conventional spray atomizers is difficult ; capillary force vaporizers offer the hope of more precise control.   HCCI engines begin where diesels leave off. Rather than injecting a stream of fuel into the combustion chamber just before ignition, HCCI mixes fuel and air upstream of the intake valves and relies on the chemistry of the mix to time its ignition in the cylinder. The result is low NO X [MASK_NOLOSS] by conventional catalytic after-treatment. The hurdles include potentially damaging high-heat releases and the difficulty of timing the ignition.   According to Reitz, a capillary force vaporizer\\'s ability to vaporize low-volatility diesel fuel at atmospheric temperatures and pressures gives the technology an edge over air-assist or other methods that produce small droplets.   A capillary force vaporizer could be applied to an HCCI engine in the manifold between turbocharger and intake valves. Or, a vaporizer could be installed in the combustion chamber itself, Reitz said.

This reflection considers both a theology of access for people with disabilities(n6) and a theology of accountability for genetic scientists and all nondisabled persons in regard to those who are disabled. CURRENT STATE OF PREIMPLANTATION, PRENATAL, AND ADULT GENETIC DIAGNOSIS   Not since the 19th-century Augustinian monk Gregor Mendel proposed the statistical probability of inheriting specific characteristics following genetically determinable lines of parent genome expression, albeit among legumes populations, has contemporary science been as close to unlocking another degree of understanding of human generation, health, and disease. Certainly, some will argue convincingly that both cloning and stem-cell isolation provide the greater part of [MASK_NOLOSS] the double helix structure of DNA, all three findings and their technologies have been compared to the first splitting of the atom. Nevertheless, with the June 2000 announcement of the near completion of the sequence of the human genome by the Human Genome Project of the U.S. Department of Energy -- five years ahead of projected schedule -- a new era of understanding the characteristics of genetic normalcy and abnormality has dawned.   The Human Genome Project, a 15-year effort begun in 1990, sought to identify, among other objectives, approximately 30,000 genes in human DNA and to determine the sequences of some 3 billion chemical base pairs that comprise these genes. The expectations of the information gained from this sequencing include the ability to recognize abnormal chemical sequences of genes associated with particular diseases and disabilities that will lead to ever more efficacious treatment and/or prevention of recurrence. Lasting treatment modalities are far from being realized, however, and prevention remains closely associated with selective abortion.

And yet, much of genomic science approaches the patient-subject of a disabling condition as if he or she has a disease which needs to be cured.

Often researchers use them as rough synonyms for objectification, but at other times, they use the terms to refer to distinct elements of the wider process of objectification. There is little agreement [MASK_NOLOSS] how these elements relate to each other. For example, Cowan and Campbell defined degrading pornography as that involving three distinct but related themes : \" domination, inequality, and objectification \" ( p. 325 ). They argued that objectification is part of a system of violence, if not violence itself, but also that violence follows from degradation. They also argued that objectification is a subset of inequality. Other authors suggest objectification is separate from degradation and is a subset of degrading behaviors ( Cowan &; Dunn, 1994 ). Yet others assume the reverse : that degrading behavior is one part of the process of objectification.   Despite the centrality of the non/degrading categorization in investigations of pornography, the validity of these constructs was not examined until 1994, when research by Cowan and Dunn found that many of these assumptions about what counted as degrading material were mistaken. In particular, and surprisingly, given the importance of the term in previous analysis of degradation and objectification in pornography, it is not clear that \" status [MASK_NOLOSS].   Cowan and Dunn ( 1994 ) showed viewers pornographic scenes which included a number of possibly degrading themes : sexually explicit behavior, availability ( casual sex ), unreciprocated sex, status reduction, status inequality, submission, penis/semen worship, dominance, and objectification. Of these, they found that dominance, objectification, and penis worship were \" the three most degrading themes \" ( p. 18 ). Dominance was defined as   sexual activity and the related scenario that explicitly shows that one partner is dominant. He or she may command the other to do what he or she wishes or insult her him without any regard for her his desires.   Objectification was defined as \" sexual activity that treats one partner as an object or a plaything, \" and penis/semen worship as \" sexual activity that revolves around worship of the penis \" ( p. 13 ).

       " '[YEAR:2005] medicine. ) Baltimore\\'s suggestion is to develop a method he calls intracellular immunization, to combat HIV. To understand the strategy, it may be useful to review some of the basic properties of viruses, and of the AIDS virus itself.   All viruses, lytic viruses as well as retroviruses, lie in a gray area between things that are truly alive and things that are not. A truly living organism must be able to reproduce, and that implies it must carry two essential components : enough genetic information to specify how to make copies of itself, and appropriate machinery for making them. Viruses possess the first, in the form of either DNA or RNA, but they lack the second. More specifically, viruses have no systems to generate the energy needed to build long chains of nucleic acids ; they have [MASK_NOLOSS] coating for new viruses ; and they carry none of the small precursors -- sugars, phosphates, amino acids, and nucleotides -- that are needed to assemble any of those larger molecules. In short, viruses travel light.   Viruses therefore are known technically as obligate intracellular parasites. To replicate, they are obliged to hijack the cell\\'s collected raw materials as well as its protein-making machinery. And to do that, they must be able to recognize the appropriate kinds of cell, and then enter such a cell to take advantage of its machinery.   HIV particles, shown in false color ( pink ) in this electron micrograph, bud off an infected T cell.   HIV gains entry to its target cell with a pair of protein molecules called gp120 and gp41, which are attached like a hair to the virus\\'s outer membrane, or \" skin \" see illustration on opposite page. Part of this molecular strand of \" hair \" is attracted to three other kinds of molecules attached to the surfaces [MASK_NOLOSS] like a key in a lock. One of the target-cell molecules is a protein called CD4, which occurs on two cells of the immune system : helper T cells and macrophages. ( Helper T cells recognize foreign substances and regulate the immune response to them. Macrophages ingest foreign particles and eliminate them from the body. )   The second target-cell molecule for HIV is a receptor known as CCR5, which normally binds to a small protein secreted by white blood cells when they encounter foreign materials. The third receptor, known as the fusion domain, is the target of gp41. When the viral protein gp120 binds to both a CD4 molecule and a chemokine receptor, and gp41 binds to the fusion domain,',\n",

The third receptor, known as the fusion domain, is the target of gp41. When the viral protein gp120 binds to both a CD4 molecule and a chemokine receptor, and gp41 binds to the fusion domain, a \" door \" to the target cell swings open. The viral membrane fuses with the cell membrane, and the virus enters the cell.   Wasting no time, the virus deploys the reverse transcriptase it has brought along. The enzyme converts HIV\\'s single-stranded genome, which is made of RNA, [MASK_NOLOSS] cell\\'s nucleus, where it splices itself into the DNA of the host cell. Once integrated with the host\\'s genetic material, the DNA version of the retroviral RNA is called a provirus. The provirus now uses host resources to copy the DNA back into RNA molecules. The new RNA then plays a double role : it forms the genome for new virus particles, and it serves as the messenger RNA that instructs the cell to synthesize HIV\\'s protein envelope. New viruses then bud off the host ( rather than simply bursting it open, as the lytic viruses do ). As one would expect, all this activity severely compromises the immune system of an infected individual : after all, the immune-system cells are working overtime to produce viruses rather than to fight them -- or any other infectious agent.   Central to Baltimore\\'s idea of intracellular immunization is a phenomenon known as viral interference. After one virus invades a host, any other virus becomes its competitor. The established virus best serves its own [MASK_NOLOSS] HIV could minimize competition essentially by locking the door behind them, once they enter the host cell. To do that, their proviral DNA could direct the host cell to make enough receptor-binding protein to fill, say, all the CD4 receptor sites on the surface of the host cell. Blocking those sites would prevent the proteins of other HIV particles from attaching to the binding sites see illustration on page 44.   Baltimore\\'s idea is that an intentionally damaged or incomplete HIV provirus might be engineered that can produce receptor-blocking proteins without doing',\n",
       " '[YEAR:2005]. Unfortunately, none of the proviral DNA is closely enough related to HIV to interfere with the HIV binding site, and so we as a species remain susceptible to the AIDS virus.   As with almost every evolutionary story, this one, too, has elements of conjecture and plausibility [MASK_NOLOSS] for anyone to go back 30 million years and ask exactly what molecular events led these defective viral genomes to be incorporated inside our own. Yet in the late 1980s a team of pathologists led by Murray B. Gardner of the University of California, Davis, discovered that a group of mice had recently developed immunity to a retroviral infection in a way that probably mirrors what happened to our primate ancestors. The mice were undergoing what primates underwent 30 million years ago -- and were showing, incidentally, that not every problem of human medicine can be answered by studying human beings.   Gardner and his colleagues became interested in retroviral infections among feral mice. In a barn on a squab farm near the town of Lake Casitas, California, they found a colony of mice in the throes of an epidemic. A particularly virulent retrovirus was spreading to young mice as they nursed. Yet within the closed population, some of the mice were clearly resistant to infection. Investigators analyzed the genomes of both the resistant and susceptible [MASK_NOLOSS] in the former group that was not present in the latter.   Molecular cloning of the locus showed that it carried a highly mutated form of the DNA copy of the retroviral genome infecting the colony. The data implied that within the group of virus-resistant mice, at least one founder had carried so many viruses in its bloodstream that the viruses were infecting other tissues, including germ cells. By the time the virus had become stably integrated with the germ-cell DNA, however, the virus had mutated, and so the mutated form was being passed along to the mouse progeny, just like the rest of the mouse genome.   The cells of these virus-resistant mice produced no viral particles. Instead, the cells produced just the viral proteins that would block the receptor molecules used by the viruses on the mouse cells, preventing complete, infectious viruses from entering. Even though the mice were presumably heavily exposed to the virus present in the barn, the defective copy of the virus they inherited was keeping new, lethal [MASK_NOLOSS] from the ravages of the disease.   Ross Bleckner, Gate #2, 1986   The Lake Casitas mouse colony offers an outstanding example of how evolutionary forces might deal with viral infections. Given the',\n",
       " '[YEAR:2005] protein, but not complete viral particles. The viral protein would block receptors used by complete HIV, protecting the T cells from infection by undamaged HIV, despite its presence elsewhere in the patient\\'s body. In other words, what Kohn and his colleagues envision is to re-create the Lake Casitas scenario within the AIDS patient. And because the new T cells would not be consumed with making complete HIV, they could endow the AIDS patient with a functional immune system and increase the patient\\'s life span.   Tampering with people\\'s genomes can clearly lead to difficult ethical dilemmas, but [MASK_NOLOSS] one thing, somatic, or body, cells, not germ cells, would be altered. Although the patient would acquire bone-marrow cells with defective provirus in their genomes, the reproduction of a complete retrovirus or its transmission to the next generation of people would be impossible.   Even if it turned out that such \" defective \" viruses, like the others I mentioned earlier, could reassemble themselves into intact viruses, such a treatment would not violate the physician\\'s credo : \" First, do no harm. \" After all, if the virus reverted to its fully functional form in a patient who was already infected with HIV, it would merely return the patient to the status quo ante. Without an effective technique to eliminate viral regeneration, however, using such treatment as a vaccine and providing it to an uninfected individual would constitute a serious moral blunder.   Blocking the receptors to which the AIDS virus normally binds when it invades a cell should prevent HIV infection. To set up the blockage, virologists [MASK_NOLOSS] that generate white blood cells. The idea is that the white blood cells infected with the partial virus would produce the viral proteins gp120 ( orange ) and gp41 ( green ), but not complete virus particles. The viral proteins would then occupy the receptors on the white-blood-cell membrane that extracellular particles of HIV normally seek, essentially jamming the lock that HIV usually picks.   After more than twenty years of war against AIDS, it is intriguing that a colony of mice in an obscure barn might one day show the way to combating the disease. That is not to say the tactic is ready for the clinic. Present technical limitations make it unlikely that the therapy will become widely available in the near future.

       " '[YEAR:2005]Section : FEATURES   Wastewater treatment systems frequently use aeration as a method of transforming organic matter into constituent elements. Some facilities use extended aeration and submerged aerators to maximize biodegradation and oxidation, and to facilitate predation. Analytical data from two facilities that use extended, submerged aeration indicate that this method effectively disinfects wastewater. Introduction   Data are presented below from two facilities where treatment cells are oxygenated with submerged aerators providing a minimum of 2.0 pounds of oxygen per pound of five-day biochemical oxygen demand ( BOD 5 ). The data show that microorganism concentrations in treated wastewater may be reduced substantially through long-term aeration. At both facilities, course bubble aerators are located from 15 to 25 feet below the water surface.   The first facility is located in Timberville, Virginia, and is permitted to accept a combined flow of up to 1,923,000 gallons per day of wastewater originating from two independent poultry-processing facilities and two towns ( municipalities ). The combined wastewater reclamation facility provides a minimum of 30 days of detention time, and it treats wastewater in two sequential, flow-through cells. [MASK_NOLOSS] of flow is provided. The samples referenced here were collected at the storage reservoir outflow - that is, prior to chlorination ( Figure 1 ).   The second facility ( Saddlebrook Farms ) treats domestic wastewater generated from a new subdivision in Round Lake Park, Illinois. This facility has a current flow of 160,000 gallons per day and uses a two-cell, flow-through design with storage integrated into each cell. No separate storage reservoir is provided ( Figure 2 ). Cell I has 20 million gallons of capacity, and Cell II has 8.3 million gallons of capacity. The facility at Saddlebrook Farms consists of a treatment facility containing these lagoons, a disinfection system, an irrigation pump station, and a wastewater irrigation system consisting of two center pivot irrigation rigs covering a total of 62 acres of cropland.

Wide excision of the ear was performed. Intraoperatively, frozen sections were obtained in an effort to ensure negative surgical margins. Gross pathologic examination identified the mass as a 3.5 x 2.5 x 2.5-cm polypoid tumor. On cross-section analysis, the tumor was firm and 0.5 cm from the deep margin.   Microscopic examination revealed that the tumor had originated in squamous epithelium. Large aggregates of basaloid epithelium were consistent with the histology of a basal cell carcinoma ( figure 2, A ). The tumor also exhibited some degree of squamous differentiation that was suggestive of a squamous cell carcinoma ( figure 2, B ). Large cystic spaces, areas of hyalinization, and focal necrosis were identified. The tumor also exhibited peripheral palisading of nuclei, some ductal differentiation, and the presence of closely associated hyalinized stroma, suggesting focal sweat gland differentiation. Mitotic figures were easily observed throughout the tumor's epithelial component. A large portion of the tumor contained a highly pleomorphic spindle-cell stroma with numerous multinucleated and bizarre cells and [MASK_NOLOSS] was most consistent with a malignant fibrous histiocytoma ( figure 2, C ).

At the 6-month postoperative follow-up, the patient manifested no evidence of distant metastasis or recurrence. Discussion   Cutaneous carcinosarcoma is a biphasic malignant tumor made up of both epithelial and mesenchymal components. ( n2, n5, n6, n11, n13, n14 ) Our review of the literature revealed a lack of consensus regarding terminology, as this entity is variously referred to as spindle-cell carcinoma, sarcomatoid carcinoma, metaplastic carcinoma, and pseudosarcoma. ( n14 )   The prognosis for cutaneous carcinosarcoma appears to be better than the prognosis for its visceral counterparts. ( n11 ) In the 20 previously reported cases of cutaneous carcinosarcoma, metastasis developed in only 4 patients ( table ). ( n2, n4, n6, n10 ) On the other hand, most patients with carcinosarcomas in other organs develop metastasis.

The most common mesenchymal component was osteosarcoma, followed by chondrosarcoma and malignant fibrous histiocytoma.   The histogenesis of these tumors remains controversial. Several theories have been suggested, including the collision tumor theory, the conversion theory, and the clonal evolution theory.

As his addiction deepened, he began crushing the tablets and inhaling the powder in increasing amounts.   Physical examination revealed that the patient had a severe saddlenose deformity secondary to a collapse of the dorsum, a complete absence of the cartilaginous septum, and a large well-healed cavity within the nose. Rigid nasal endoscopy confirmed the absence of the septum and extensive erosion of the turbinates ( figure 1, A ). Oral examination revealed a very large defect of the soft palate ( figure 1, B ). Computed tomography ( CT ) confirmed the damage to the nasal structures ( figure 2 ). The patient declined surgical treatment for the defects. Discussion   The problem of nasal necrosis secondary to cocaine abuse is familiar to most practicing otolaryngologists. To [MASK_NOLOSS] case is the first reported occurrence of damage to the septum and palate linked to noncocaine intranasal narcotic abuse. The ubiquity of crushed OxyContin inhalation will likely prompt many other victims to seek otolaryngologic care.   The approach to the intranasal drug-abusing patient requires an understanding of the differential diagnosis of septal perforation, its evaluation, and the mechanism of tissue necrosis secondary to inhaled substances. The best-understood intranasal drug is cocaine. The mechanism of tissue necrosis in cocaine abuse is related to vasoconstriction that occurs as a result of sympathetic stimulation caused by the inhibition of norepinephrine and epinephrine reuptake. In addition, cocaine induces additional vasoconstriction by stimulating vascular smooth muscle contraction. Chronic vasoconstriction leads to mucosal ischemia, atrophy, and ultimately necrosis. In addition, the additives with which cocaine is diluted ( mannitol, talcum powder, etc. ) serve as mechanical and chemical irritants, leading to giant-cell granulomatous reactions that may be destructive and mimic other granulomatous diseases.

The complex of findings in nasal cocaine abuse -- and now intranasal noncocaine narcotic abuse -- includes nasal collapse, septal perforation, palatal retraction, and pharyngeal wall ulceration. ( n3 ) The irritation induced by chronic inflammation can mimic sinusitis and both allergic and nonallergic rhinitis. Once the condition has progressed to septal perforation and tissue necrosis, the clinical findings can mimic midline granulomatous disease, severe bacterial infection, allergic fungal sinusitis, and cancer. Because addicts often conceal their drug use, many of these disorders are evaluated and treated before the clinician discovers that they were caused by intranasal drug abuse.   The differential diagnosis of nasal septal perforation and midline nasal granulomatous disease includes Wegener's granulomatosis, sarcoidosis, T-cell lymphoma and other malignancies, autoimmune disease, vasculitis, and trauma. Ideally, evaluation should include a biopsy, measurement of [MASK_NOLOSS] other laboratory evaluations to rule out sarcoidosis and autoimmune disease. Notably, c-ANCA may be elevated in cocaine-induced septal perforation. ( n7, n11 ) Unfortunately, drug addiction is often accompanied by noncompliance with medical advice, which can hinder the completion of a full work-up.   Reconstruction of damaged nasal structures often requires repair of the nasal septum and the framework of the nasal tip and valve. Unfortunately, the success of reconstruction is dependent on the patient refraining from further drug abuse.

       " '[YEAR:2005]Section : ORIGINAL ARTICLE Abstract   Brown tumor, an uncommon focal giant-cell lesion, arises as a direct result of the effect of parathyroid hormone on bone tissue in patients with hyperparathyroidism. The initial treatment involves the correction of hyperparathyroidism, which usually leads to tumor regression. We report a case of brown tumor of the right nasal fossa in a 71-year-old woman. The tumor had caused nasal obstruction and epistaxis. Laboratory evaluation revealed that the patient had primary hyperparathyroidism. Anatomicopathologic investigation revealed the presence of a giant-cell tumor. We performed a partial parathyroidectomy, but the tumor in the right nasal fossa failed to regress. One year later, we performed surgical resection of the lesion. The patient recovered uneventfully, and she remained asymptomatic and recurrence-free at the 1-year follow-up. Facial lesions with histologic features of a giant-cell tumor should be evaluated from a systemic standpoint. Hyperparathyroidism should always be investigated by laboratory tests because most affected patients are asymptomatic. Surgical resection of a brown tumor should be considered if the mass does not regress after correction of the inciting hyperparathyroidism or if the patient [MASK_NOLOSS] uncommon focal giant-cell lesion, arises as a direct result of the effect of parathyroid hormone on bone tissue in some patients with hyperparathyroidism. Brown tumors can affect the mandible, maxilla, clavicle, ribs, and pelvic bones. ( n1 ) Radiographic and histologic changes associated with the presence of this lesion may be very similar to those of other bone lesions of the face. Therefore, the diagnosis requires a systemic investigation for lesion differentiation.   We report a case of brown tumor in an elderly woman, and we discuss the clinical history, differential diagnosis, diagnosis, and treatment of this type of lesion.

No bone erosion was evident. Biopsy of the mass revealed that it was a giant-cell tumor.   Laboratory evaluation revealed that the patient had primary hyperparathyroidism, as her parathyroid hormone level was 988 pg/ml ( normal : 12 to 72 ).

Most patients with hyperparathyroidism are asymptomatic, as was our patient. Hypercalcemia is often discovered incidentally during routine laboratory testing ; hypophosphatemia and increased alkaline phosphatase levels in blood may also be seen.

They are rare, but when they do occur, they usually develop in older patients and they primarily involve the long bones. They also have a tendency to recur. Because of their infiltrative nature, true giant-cell tumors are difficult to remove surgically. Histologic analysis reveals giant cells around a fibrous stroma and some degree of cellular atypia.

Our patient required surgical removal. Brown tumor can recur if hyperparathyroidism persists or recurs. ( n2 )   Figure 1. CT of the paranasal sinuses shows the dense area in the right nasal fossa.

       " '[YEAR:2005]Section : ORIGINAL ARTICLE Abstract   Spindle-cell hemangioendothelioma is an uncommon vascular lesion that exhibits a predilection for the extremities. Very few reports have been published describing this lesion in the head and neck, and to the best of our knowledge, its occurrence in the oropharynx has not been previously reported. In addition to reporting an unusual site of this lesion, our rationale for publishing this case is to comment on the diagnostic dilemma that arose in view of an unclear clinicohistopathologic pattern and to discuss this lesion\\'s similarity to other aggressive tumors. Introduction   In 1988, Enzinger and Weiss described a \" new \" vascular tumor that resembled a cavernous hemangioma and Kaposi\\'s sarcoma ; they called it a spindle-cell hemangioendothelioma. ( n1 ) It was considered to be a low-grade angiosarcoma. The most common locations are the superficial soft tissues of the distal portions of the extremities. The tumor is slowly progressive but locally aggressive. It has a tendency to recur, but no metastasis has been documented. ( n2 )   We report the case of a young man who presented with a mass [MASK_NOLOSS] as a spindle-cell hemangioendothelioma. After reviewing the literature, we determined to the best of our knowledge that no other case of this tumor in the oropharynx has been previously reported, although there have been a few isolated reports of spindle-cell angiosarcoma and Kaposi\\'s sarcoma affecting the oropharynx. ( n3, n4 ) Case report   A 25-year-old man presented with a 6-month history of slowly progressive swallowing difficulty, a change in voice, and breathing difficulty at night. On oropharyngeal examination, a hemispherical, mucosa-covered, pinkish mass was noted to have arisen from the posterior pharyngeal wall. The mass measured approximately 6 x 6 cm. On indirect laryngoscopy, the cystic mass extended from the posterior pharyngeal wall up to the epiglottis, and it obscured the view of the endolarynx. No lymph nodes were palpable on examination of the neck.   Fine-needle aspiration yielded a straw-colored fluid. Cytologic examination of the fluid identified only neutrophils and lymphocytes and was nondiagnostic. Contrastenhanced computed tomography ( CT ) demonstrated a mildly enhancing globular swelling arising from the [MASK_NOLOSS] 3.5 cm ( figure 1 ).

Following elective tracheotomy, the patient was kept in the supine position with the atlantooccipital joint extended. A Boyle Davis mouth gag was placed, and a 4-cm submucosal vertical incision was made. The tumor was excised completely via blunt dissection. The incision was sutured after complete hemostasis was ensured. On gross morphology, the tumor was a well-encapsulated spherical mass ; after the lesion was cut, irregular areas of empty spaces were evident ( figure 3 ).   Figure 3. After cutting, irregular empty spaces are seen in the gross specimen.   Histopathologic examination identified cavernous spaces [MASK_NOLOSS] cells were arranged in fascicles, and they exhibited bland-appearing nuclei with irregular cytoplasmic borders ( figure 4 ).

The age distribution is wide, although most reported cases have occurred between the second and fourth decades of life. ( n2 ) Our patient's age ( 25 yr ) coincided very well with that typically reported for spindle-cell hemangioendothelioma.   These tumors can appear as solitary or multiple cutaneous and subcutaneous nodules. They are either vascular and hemorrhagic or firm and pale with foci of hemorrhage. The most common sites are the superficial soft tissues of the lower and upper limbs, followed by the trunk, vulva, penis, and ear. The first reported case of a spindle-cell hemangioendothelioma in the oral cavity occurred [MASK_NOLOSS] mandibular-buccal fold. ( n2 )   Etiology. The etiopathogenesis of spindle-cell hemangioendothelioma is unknown. Originally considered to be a vascular neoplasm with malignant potential, the facts that argue against it being malignant are the absence of reported metastases, its long clinical course, and its tendency toward multifocality. Moreover, microscopic examination reveals a low degree of proliferative cell activity and a lack of cellular atypia and mitosis. The idea that spindle-cell hemangioendotheliomas are nonneoplastic was advocated by Fletcher et al, who reported that these tumors arise in association with a local acquired or congenital focal abnormality of blood flow at the affected site. ( n4 )   Other authors have postulated that injury is a possible etiology, pointing out that the lesions arise at sites of repeated injections or surgical excisions and that they frequently arise on the distal extremities. ( n4, n5 ) No such history was elicited from our patient, although a possible etiology in this case might have been the repeated impact of food boluses on the posterior pharyngeal wall during the pharyngeal stage of swallowing [MASK_NOLOSS] reactive vascular proliferation caused by successive episodes of angioformation occurring during the recanalization process after thrombosis.

( n6 )   Cellular characteristics. In addition to spindle-cell hemangioendothelioma, other vascular lesions that have a prominent spindle-cell component include Kaposi's sarcoma and angiosarcoma. ( n3 ) Both Kaposi's sarcoma and spindle-cell hemangioendothelioma contain spindle-cell stroma, but only the latter contains dilated blood vessels and epithelioid endothelial cells. ( n4 ) Histopathologic examination of a spindle-cell hemangioendothelioma reveals cavernous spaces, which may contain organizing thrombi at different stages of organization. Between the cavernous spaces is a proliferation of bland-appearing spindle cells with elongated nuclei ; these cells are arranged either in interlacing short fascicles or randomly. Unlike the case with Kaposi's sarcoma, these areas also contain occasional rounded or epithelioid endothelial cells, similar to those seen in epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. ( n1 ) Spindle-cell hemangioendothelioma and epithelioid hemangioendothelioma share many features, [MASK_NOLOSS] an absence of cavernous spaces, thrombi, phleboliths, and discrete spindle-cell areas.   Diagnosis. Although our patient reported a 6-month history of symptoms, his lesion may have been present for a longer time, as evidenced by the size of the swelling and the predominance of cavernous spaces on histopathologic examination.   A mass on the posterior pharyngeal wall could be caused by a chronic tubercular retropharyngeal abscess, a lipoma, a neurofibroma, a synovial sarcoma, or some other type of tumor. A synovial sarcoma might be suspected when a circumscribed mass posterior to the pharynx exhibits hemorrhage and fluid-fluid levels.

( n7 ) Most such tumors, however, are variable in appearance, and a diagnosis based solely on radiologic investigations can not be made with confidence. Other lesions that should be considered in the differential diagnosis include a cavernous hemangioma, a papillary endothelial hyperplasia, a disseminated lobular capillary hemangioma, and epithelioid angiomatosis. ( n2 )   Based on CT findings, the lesion in our patient was reported as a benign cystic mass [MASK_NOLOSS] to establish a diagnosis via aspiration cytology, so we planned an excisional biopsy. Because the lesion was reported as benign, we were able to easily excise it via a peroral route. No vascular malformations or abnormal vessels were seen in the vicinity of the lesion.   Treatment. Wide local excision is usually adequate for removing solitary or multiple adjacent lesions, although angiographic examination is advised to assess the possibility of a clinically occult vascular abnormality.   Recurrence. Perkins and Weiss evaluated 78 patients with spindle-cell hemangioendothelioma and found that approximately 60% of them experienced a local recurrence. ( n8 ) Recurrences are known to arise within the immediate area of a previous surgical site. According to Fletcher et al, it is highly likely that patients with multiple lesions that have developed over a prolonged period are manifesting a \" field-change \" effect rather than a true recurrence or biological progression. ( n4 ) They recommended a thorough angiographic examination for all such patients. Reported recurrences most likely represent separate primaries because they develop in previously uninvolved adjacent tissue [MASK_NOLOSS] After 4 years of follow-up, our patient remained free of any local recurrence and any new lesion.   Metastasis. To the best of our knowledge, no case of regional or distant metastasis has been documented.   In conclusion, pathologists and clinicians alike should be aware of the existence of spindle-cell hemangioendotheliomas.

       " \"[YEAR:2006]From bacteria to blue whales, organisms live in worlds defined by their size. The implications for movement, metabolism, and even life span are surprisingly diverse.   When I was a student and first saw, through a microscope, one-cell protozoa moving across my field of vision, I marveled at how fast they traveled. Later I realized that they were in fact moving very slowly and that the magnification of the microscope had fooled me. After all, speed is distance divided by time, and the high power of the microscope made the minute distance appear quite large. The image of those microscopic protozoa zipping around at an incredible rate was an optical illusion. It was rather disappointing to learn that the microworld was not dazzlingly fast but rather sedate.   I suppose it was only natural that I perceived my first protozoa from my own frame of reference. I judged them not on their terms -- taking account of how their small size might affect how they interacted with their environment, how they moved in space and through time -- but on my own [MASK_NOLOSS] live in a world almost inconceivably different from the one that protozoa inhabit. Among living organisms, size is everything. It is the supreme regulator of all matters biological, and thus a prime mover in evolution. Size governs the shape and activities of all organisms, from the smallest bacteria to the largest whale -- which, remarkably, differ in mass by some twenty-one orders of magnitude. Size is the universal determinant of what any organism can be and can do.   Size matters most because of its direct effects on various physical properties. An organism of any given size must have enough strength to support itself and to move. It must have a surface that allows enough oxygen and food to reach its inner tissues. It must have a proper division of labor among the structures of its body, and an appropriate rate of metabolism for those structures to function. Ultimately, an organism's size determines everything about it, including its abundance, rate of locomotion, generation time, longevity, and anything else [MASK_NOLOSS] deal about an organism, including its basic shape. Here an elephant is depicted as it would appear at a third of its natural size ( below left ), at its natural size ( near right ), and at three times its natural size ( far right ).

The eyes of the blind mole rat are covered with skin and fur, but the animal can distinguish external light intensity. The gray tones in the bars above their photographs show how efficiently their monochromatic sensors respond to input colors across the range visible to humans.     An organism that has lost great swaths of functional DNA is the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae, the pathogen that causes leprosy. Gene sequencing has shown that the M. leprae genome carries about 1,600 functional genes and about 1,100 fossil genes -- a far greater proportion of fossil genes than that of any other known species. M. leprae is closely related to M. tuberculosis, the species responsible for pulmonary tuberculosis [MASK_NOLOSS] genes and only about six fossil genes. Comparing the genomes of the two species shows that M. leprae has fossilized or lost some 2,000 genes in the course of its evolution. What explains the vast disparity between the two bacteria?   Once again, the answer comes down to lifestyle : M. leprae's is very different from that of its cousin. The leprosy bacterium can live only within cells of its host ; in fact, despite decades of effort, it has never been grown on its own in the laboratory. It is also the slowest-growing bacterium of all known bacterial species : it takes about two weeks to divide. ( Compare that with the E. coli in the human gut, which can divide every twenty minutes. ) M. leprae's specialized mode of living has enabled it to rely on its host for many functions it would otherwise have to carry out on its own. Since the host-cell genes do so much of the work, natural selection'has relaxed its control on maintaining many M. leprae [MASK_NOLOSS] on a massive scale. The example demonstrates that a large fraction of all the genes in an organism's genome can become dispensable when its lifestyle shifts.

The fossilization of individual genes, sets of genes that build metabolic pathways, or even larger groups of genes has important consequences for the evolution of an organism\\'s descendants. Because decaying genes accumulate multiple defects, their inactivation can not readily be reversed. So the loss of gene functions is generally a one-way street -- once gone, the functions will not return.   \" Use it or lose it \" is an absolute rule imposed by the fact that surveillance by natural selection acts only in the present, without planning for the future. The downside is that if circumstances change, even very slowly, the lost genes will not be available to adapt to the new circumstances. The one-way loss of genes may be an important factor in the success or extinction of species. Keep in mind that biologists think that more than 99 percent of all species that [MASK_NOLOSS] gene fossilization and loss is a powerful argument against the idea of \" design \" or intent in the origin of species. The leprosy bacterium, for instance, is a stripped-down version of its former self, carrying around more than a thousand useless, broken genes that are vestiges of its ancestry. Such a history of trial and error is hardly evidence of design. Similarly, people carry around the genetic vestiges of an ol-factory system that was once much more acute than the one we have today.   The patterns of gain and loss are exactly what one would expect if natural selection acts only in the present, not the way an engineer or a designer would. Natural selection can not preserve what is not being used, and it can not plan for the future.

Our patient had an adipocytic WDL ; on microscopic examination, his tumor clearly demonstrated the classic histopathologic characteristics of liposarcomas : variably sized mature adipocytes, widened fibrous septa, lipocytic atypia and, most important, lipoblasts with multivacuolated cytoplasm and scalloped nuclei ( figure 2 ).

However, the taxonomy of WDLs has become a source of some confusion and considerable debate between pathologists and surgeons. Tumors meeting the classic histopathologic criteria for WDLs that arise in the oral cavity, salivary glands, and other superficial, surgically accessible areas are called atypical lipomatous tumors ( ALTs ). Deeply seated and inaccessible masses of the mediastinum, retroperitoneum, cervical muscles, pharynx, and larynx are called well-differentiated liposarcomas. ( n3,\",\n",
       " \"[YEAR:2006]Section : ORIGINAL ARTICLE   Temporal bone lymphomas are rare and typically metastatic neoplasms. We describe a case of primary B cell lymphoma that originated in the external auditory canal of an elderly woman. The diagnosis was based on histopathologic examination supplemented by immunophenotypic analysis. The patient was treated with external-beam radiation and remained disease-free throughout 9 years of follow-up. We also point out that the presence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in an unusual site may be an indication that the patient has an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Introduction   Although lymphomas account for the largest number of nonepithelial malignancies of the head and neck, these lymphoproliferative neoplasms seldom present in the temporal bone area. During our review of the literature, it became incontrovertibly clear that isolated case reports of temporal bone lymphomas generally represented either metastatic foci from distant primaries or encroachment from contiguous locations. ( n1, n2 ) Sporadic cases of primary extranodal lymphoproliferative malignancies originating in the temporal bone area have been reported ; potential sites of origin include the middle ear, ( n3-n5 ) mastoid, ( n5, n6 ) internal auditory canal, ( [MASK_NOLOSS] ) In this article, we report a case of primary B cell lymphoma that originated in the external auditory canal, a site reported only rarely in the literature. Case report   An 83-year-old woman presented with a 6-week history of fullness and diminished hearing in the left ear. She denied any ear pain or discharge, and she could not recall any antecedent upper respiratory infection or recent ear trauma. Her medical history was limited to hypertension and Paget's disease.   Routine and microscopic examinations of the left ear canal revealed the presence of a blue-hued, circumferential swelling that prevented clear visualization of the tympanic membrane. Multiple needle aspirations of the lesion yielded no aspirate and caused no notable decompression of the lesion. Audiometric testing revealed a severe to profound, high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss in the right ear and a mixed loss in the left ear. Prior to a planned biopsy, computed tomography ( CT ) of the temporal bone clearly delineated the outline of a soft-tissue lesion confined entirely to the left ear canal ( figure [MASK_NOLOSS] the petrous bone shows the soft-tissue mass in the left external auditory canal.

Histologic examination of the biopsy specimen revealed that it was a diffuse large-cell lymphoma ( figure 2 ). Partial infiltration of the fibroconnective tissue by atypical mononuclear cells was seen. The cells had large nuclei, frequent multiple nucleoli, and a moderate amount of cytoplasm -- histologic features that are consistent with diffuse large-cell lymphoma. The surrounding tissue exhibited evidence of inflammation. Immunophenotypic analysis of the tumor was performed via a three-step immunoperoxidase method. The paraffin tissue sections were stained with antibodies to CD20 ( L26 ), CD3, CD68 ( PGM-1 ), lysozyme, CD43 ( Leu 22 ), CAM 5.2, and AE1/AE3.   Figure 2. The large neoplastic-appearing cells have features of lymphoid cells ( H &E,; original magnification x400 ).

Discussion   Lymphomas typically present as solid, malignant neoplasms that arise from lymphocytes and their respective precursor cells. These malignancies are generally grouped into one of two major categories : Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. These two entities have distinctive clinical and histologic features.

This article reviews the types of rechargeable batteries that are available, including their composition and charging and discharging capabilities.   Batteries are energy storage devices. In [MASK_NOLOSS] react and produce voltage differences between positive and negative electrodes. These differences produce current flow in the energy forms to power products. The chemical flowing agent is referred to as the electrolyte. Figure 1 on the previous page shows a typical sealed lead-acid battery that may be used in a variety of high-current-demand applications.   The power demand and chemical compositions determine the life of a battery. It also depends on whether the batteries are deemed useless after they are discharged or if the reverse flow of electricity through the chemicals can extend their usefulness ( recharge ). Some newer batteries have to be cycled ( charged/discharged ) several times to build their capacity. It needs to be noted that there is no such thing as 100 percent reusable energy in a rechargeable battery. No matter how we invent or classify the renewable energy, there are always losses, losses in material or gases generated. Lead-Acid Battery   The lead-acid battery is a well-known device used in various equipment, such as cars, construction equipment, and heavy duty [MASK_NOLOSS] heavy because of its lead-cell construction. Lead-acid batteries usually are manufactured as a six-cell integrated battery that produces a maximum output of 12 volts.   The lead-acid battery has a positive plate, the lead-acid storage cell, which is made of lead peroxide, PbO 2. There is also a negative plate of pure sponge lead, Pb, per cell. Diluted sulfuric acid, H 2 SO 4, is used as the electrolyte to allow the electrons to flow back and forth to produce the electrical charge. When the cell supplies current to a load, i.e., to turn the starter motor of a car or generator, it discharges. The chemical action that takes place forms lead sulfate, PbSO 4, on both plates of the battery, with water being formed in the electrolyte. To recharge the cell, a current is supplied to flow through the cell in an opposite direction. This reversed chemical process causes lead peroxide to have an exchange between the positive plate and the pure lead negative plates, thus [MASK_NOLOSS] fully discharged lead-acid battery causes extra strain on the exchange, and each discharge/charge cycle robs the battery of a small amount of capacity. This loss is very small while the battery is in good operating condition',\n",

Lithium Ion Polymer ( Li-ion Polymer or Li-Poly ) Battery   Li-ion Polymer batteries have technologically evolved from the Li-ion battery. Their design is different from other battery systems. They use dry solid polymers as the electrolyte. The standard lithium-ion battery uses lithium salts as its electrolyte. In the Li-Poly, a solid polymer composite, such as polyacrylonitrile, is used. There are many advantages of this design over the [MASK_NOLOSS] is not flammable ( unlike the organic solvent that the Li-ion cell uses ) ; thus, these batteries are less dangerous to flaming if they are mistreated. The dry polymer design offers simpler fabrication, increased ruggedness and safety, and slimmer profiles for flexible shape designs.   Lithium ion polymer batteries started appearing in consumer electronics in the mid-90s. The Li-Polymer cells are flexible and can be made in foil-type ( polymer laminate ) cases. These batteries can be lighter and shaped differently to fit the devices they are to power. The elimination of cylindrical metal casing and inter-cell spacing can increase the energy density to over 10 percent of the capacity of the predecessor Li-ion batteries and are approximately three times better in performance than NiCd or NiMH batteries. Figure 5 shows examples of rechargeable Lithium Ion batteries.   The Li-Polymer cell has voltages ranging from 2.7V ( discharged ) to 4.23V ( fully charged ).   Overcharging a Li-Polymer is dangerous and can result in explosions and/or fire, so these cells have to be protected by limiting [MASK_NOLOSS] discharge on a load, the load has to be removed as soon as the voltage drops below 3.0V per cell, otherwise the battery cell will subsequently no longer be rechargeable ( Cadex, 2006 ). Comparisons and Choices of the Rechargeable Batteries   There are many batteries to choose from when designing power equipment or when replacing batteries. There are no simple designs for batteries to fit all applications, with initial start charge often dictating the battery selected. The choice of a battery is strictly dependent on its application, cost effectiveness, conditions of use, and life cycles/aging consideration. Table 1 provides a comparison between those batteries discussed. Recharging Batteries   Lead-acid batteries are designed for starting services, to start an automobile for example, but are not for deep discharges ( long continuous power ).

The discrepancy between [MASK_NOLOSS] techniques. Specifically, in contrast with the methods used by Rajaram et al, 2 we did not use antigen retrieval in our study.   One additional previous study examined claudin-1 expression in meningiomas ; however, this study was published only in abstract form. 13 Bhattacharjee et al 13 reported immunoreactivity for claudin-1 in 17 ( 85% ) of 20 meningiomas, but the histologic type and grade were not specified. These authors also reported negative staining for claudin-1 in all 10 schwannomas they examined, similar to our results. However, our study also examined claudin-1 expression in SFTs of the meninges, which can be difficult to distinguish from meningiomas with spindled morphologic features ; all cases were negative.   Meningiomas are thought to originate from the cell clusters capping the arachnoid villi. 14 In addition to other morphologic and ultrastructural similarities, meningiomas and arachnoidal cap cells have numerous cell adhesion structures. However, although tight junctions are seen in arachnoid cells, the cell adhesion structures in meningiomas are desmosome-like. Claudins are understood to be components of [MASK_NOLOSS] be explained?

[MASK_NOLOSS] asthma is a disorder involving the airway epithelium, which is more vulnerable to environmental injury and responds to this by impaired healing 63. this inflammation establishes a chronic wound scenario that is capable of sustaining chronic inflammation as well as remodeling 59. holgate also has pointed out that this response occurs as a consequence of activation of epithelial-mesenchymal unit, involving reciprocal activities of growth factors belonging to the fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and transforming growth factor families 59. moreover, according to the same author it was observed that structural changes in the airways in children at or before the onset of asthma occur irrespective of inflammation. these facts might suggest, that pre-modeling is required before th2 inflammatory responses can be sustained 59. in this respect, once established, altered function of constitutive airway cells, including fibroblasts, smooth muscle, neuronal fibers, and the epithelium, provides an abnormal microenvironment, in which can be generated a separate set of signals that underpin the acute/sub-acute inflammation characteristics of asthma exacerbations, triggered by viruses, pollutants, and [MASK_NOLOSS] remodelation, it might be considered them not only as the reasons of patient suffering, but also as reason for failure of physiologic activity fulfilling. In this framework, the organism can not support different functional requirements ( like physical charges ).

However, returning once again on the reflections about asthma pathology, it could be suggested that bronchial remodeling might assure some minimal advantages for the asthmatic patient. Also, fibrocytes can be precursors of myo-fibroblasts too.

Therefore, smooth muscle hyperplasia can lead [MASK_NOLOSS] effectively avoidance of contact with different stimuli.

The possibilities for germline engineering go beyond the elimination of disease and open the door for modifications to human longevity, increased intelligence, increased muscle mass, and many other types of genetic enhancements. This application is by far the more consequential, because it opens the door to the alteration of the human species. The modified genes would appear not only in any children that resulted from such procedures, but in all succeeding generations.   The term germline refers to the germ or germinal cells, i.e., the eggs and sperm. [MASK_NOLOSS] that make up the body. They are found in long coiled chains called chromosomes located in the nuclei of the cells of the body. Genetic modification occurs by inserting genes into living cells. The desired gene is attached to a viral vector, which has the ability to carry the gene across the cell membrane. Proposals for inheritable genetic modification in humans combine techniques involving in vitro fertilization, gene transfer, stem cells, and cloning. Germline modification would begin by using IVF to create a single-cell embryo or zygote. This embryo would develop for about five days to the blastocyst stage ( very early embryo consisting of approximately 150 cells. It contains the inner cell mass, from which embryonic stem cells are derived, and an outer layer of cells called the trophoblast that forms the placenta. ( It is approximately 1/10 the size of the head of a pin. ) At this point embryonic stem cells would be removed. ( Figure 2 ) These stem cells would be altered by adding genes using viral vectors.

This \" constructed embryo \" would then be implanted into a woman\\'s uterus and brought to term. The child born would be a genetically modified human ( Inheritable, 2003 ).   Proponents of germline manipulation assume that once a gene implicated in a particular condition is identified, it might be appropriate and relatively easy to replace, change, supplement, or otherwise modify that gene. However, biological characteristics or traits usually depend on interactions among many genes and, more importantly, the activity of genes is affected by various processes that occur both inside the organism and',\n",

New therapeutic targets   Rheumatoid arthritis is a complex autoimmune disease, involving multiple immune pathways and cell types. 9 The immunopathology of RA involves activated T cells, which mediate immune processes within the synovium, resulting in the release of cytokines, autoantibodies and other inflammatory mediators from macrophages, T cells and B cells. 10 These, in turn, stimulate the downstream release of further inflammatory mediators resulting in the direct attack upon joint structures by macrophage- and fibroblast-like synoviocytes and other cells. 10 In order to become fully activated, a T cell must not only recognize an antigen that has been processed and presented by an antigen presenting cell [MASK_NOLOSS]. 11 One of the best characterized co-stimulatory pathways is the engagement of CD80/CD86 on APCs with CD28 on T cells. 11 Another co-stimulatory pathway involves the CD40 ligand, in which T cells interact with B cells via the CD40:CD40L pathway, thereby facilitating B-cell activation and the production of autoantibodies. 12 T-cell activation is also downregulated by co-stimulatory pathways. The CD28-mediated T-cell activation is downregulated by expression of endogenous cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 ( CTLA-4 ), 13 which binds to CD80/CD86 with a much higher affinity than CD28. 14   The elucidation of RA immunopathology has led to the development of novel forms of therapy, two of which have recently been approved for the treatment of RA.',\n",

Abatacept   Abatacept is the first in a new class of agents that selectively modulates the CD80/CD86:CD28 pathway of T-cell co-stimulation. 18 It is a soluble, recombinant, fully-human fusion protein, comprising the extracellular domain of CTLA-4 linked to the Fc ( hinge, CH2 and CH3 domains ) portion of immunoglobulin G1.   Abatacept acts by binding to CD80/CD86 on APCs and preventing its interaction with CD28 on T cells. 18 Whereas most RA therapies target one specific cytokine or molecule involved at the end stages of RA immunopathology, 9 the novel mechanism of action of abatacept - acting at the level of the T cell - provides the potential to impact multiple downstream events. This has been demonstrated by reductions in multiple inflammatory biomarkers following treatment with abatacept in patients with active RA and an inadequate response to MTX or TNF antagonists. 19 By selectively modulating the CD80/CD86:CD28 pathway, 18 abatacept may allow other co-stimulatory pathways [MASK_NOLOSS] other possible co-stimulation pathways. 20   In the US, abatacept is indicated for reducing signs and symptoms, inducing a major clinical response, slowing the progression of structural damage and improving physical function, in adult patients with moderate-to-severely active RA who have had an inadequate response to one or more DMARDs, such as MTX or TNF antagonists. 19 Abatacept may be used as monotherapy or concomitantly with non-biologic DMARDs, but is not recommended for use concomitantly with TNF antagonists or anakinra. 21 Efficacy of abatacept in clinical studies   Several randomized, multinational, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with active RA have assessed the efficacy and safety of abatacept in patients with an inadequate response to MTX, 22',\n",

It might be due to the fact that more number of men suffers from respiratory problems. Age of the patients is one of the major determinants for the use of this vaccine. In our study the number of elderly patients receiving the vaccine was high. In a retrospective cohort study the pneumococcal vaccine was effective in preventing pneumococcal bacteremic disease in elderly patients. 15In another case-control study, pneumococcal vaccine was 70% effective in preventing pneumococcal infection in the immunocompetent elderly. 16 This is similar to the efficacy of the vaccine in the general immunocompetent population.

Recent studies have shown restricted and oligoclonal T-cell repertoires from lesions, suggesting an antigen driven response. 4 A polygenic mode of inheritance with HLA pre-disposition is thought to underlie AA as in other autoimmune diseases. 5 AA is associated with other autoimmune diseases such as vitiligo, thyroid disease, pernicious anemia, and atopic dermatitis but [MASK_NOLOSS] We have reported two young men who were initially diagnosed with alopecia areata but subsequently developed follicular papules and patches of early MF.

There was a significant association of either DQB1*0503 or DRB1*1405 with PV, and a negative association with PV of either DQA1*0103 or DQB1*0601 alleles. Since the DQB1*0503-positive patients had various DR14-related alleles, the authors concluded that the association with DQB1 is primary and [MASK_NOLOSS] disequilibrium between the DQ and DR genes.

The observation that Dsg3-specific T-cell responses were detected in PV patients but also in healthy individuals who were either carriers of the PV-associated DRB1*0402 allele or alleles that share similar or identical peptide binding motifs to DRB1*0402, suggested that [MASK_NOLOSS] the development of the autoimmune response. Slomov et al. used 16 microsatellite probes that span the entire MHC region to screen DNA samples from 38 PV patients and 76 healthy controls 50. The study demonstrated that some markers were associated with class II region including a TAP associated marker. However, four probes, D6S265, C527, D6S510, and MOGC, which are all mapped to the region of HLA-A, were also highly associated with PV. These results suggested that a gene, or genes in the class I region might be important for the initiation of the autoimmune cascade. HLA specificities in Turkish PV patients   Birol et al. investigated the antigen frequencies of HLA-A, B, C, HLA-DR and DQ in Turkish patients with PV by typing of HLA class I and II antigens in 33 patients with PV and 100 healthy individuals by microdroplet lymphocyte cytotoxicity test 52. Occurrence of HLA-B35, B44, CW4, DR4, DR14, DQ8 and DQ4 antigens was significantly higher in the study group, whereas HLA-DR11 [MASK_NOLOSS]. The most striking differences were observed in HLA class II antigens. HLA DR14-DQ8 and HLA B35-DR14 haplotypes were most frequently observed in the study group. Thus, HLA-B35, B44, CW4, DR4, DR14, DQ4 and DQ8 antigens may be responsible for susceptibility to PV, while HLA-DR11, DQ7 and DQ2 antigens may have a protective role in the Turkish population. On the other hand, it can not be excluded that that the exogenous factors might induce PV in genetically predisposed individuals. HLA typing of PV patients in Italy   Lombardi et al. reported on HLA molecular typing of 87 patients, 61 with PV and 26 with PF, versus 128 healthy matched controls 53. Generic typing showed an increase of DRB1*04 and DRB1*14 and',\n",

Thus, DQB1*0503, rather than DRB1*1401, is more likely to be the disease-conferring allele in non-Jewish Caucasian PV patients.   In order to assess whether a preventative benefit is conferred by carrying a negatively associated allele, a haplotypic analysis was applied to respective control populations. The data showed no significant differences in frequency of the eight negatively associated alleles. Therefore, none of these underrepresented alleles demonstrates a protective role in DRB1*0402-linked [MASK_NOLOSS] population, the frequency of underrepresented DQA1*0501 allele was compared in controls who were carriers of the PV-associated allele, DQB1*0503 versus non-carriers. No significant differences in the frequency of DQA*0501 was detected, suggesting that there was no protective effect of DQA1*0501 allele in PV. Polymorphisms in HLA Pocket Residues   To further detect the functional relevance of candidate loci, primary sequence comparisons between reported PV associated and PV non-associated HLA alleles have been undertaken. Since disease-associated alleles can be expected to share common features within their antigen-binding clefts required for peptide binding and T-cell activation as a requisite for disease induction, specific residues within critical pockets ( P1, 4, 6, 7 and 9 ) of relevant DRB1, DQB1, and DQA1 molecules were compared to segregate disease-relevant sequences among overrepresented alleles and haplotypes. DRB1 pocket polymorphisms   Two negatively charged amino acid residues within the DRB1 binding pocket have been postulated as critical to the binding of positively charged self-peptides in PV patients 59 66 67 68. Negatively charged residues within pocket 4 ( P4 ), [MASK_NOLOSS], are found in the PV-associated allele, DRB1*0402. Although DRB1*1401 has been associated with PV in several populations 41 43 46 53 54 55 56 59 65, sequence comparison with other DR*04 and DR*14 nonoPV-associated alleles reveals that DRB1*1401 is more similar to disease-unrelated alleles. In contrast to DRB1*0402, DRB1*1401 has a positively charged amino acid at residues 70 and 71 ( Arg ), as do two nonoPV-associated alleles, DRB1*1405 and *1406. These data support our analysis of LD',\n",

DQA1*0101 was underrepresented in Ashkenazi Jewish patients in one study 39, however, it has been positively associated with disease in Indian, Pakistani, and non-Jewish Europeans PV patients 42 43.   The overrepresentation of DQA1*0505 and under-representation of DQA1*0501 detected in both non-Jewish Caucasian and Ashkenazi Jewish patients have not been previously described in other PV populations. Multiple differences are detected when the sequences of DQA1*0505 and DQA1*0501 are compared to both PV- and nonoPV-associated alleles. Furthermore, DQA1*0505 and DQA1*0501 are identical across key pocket-forming residues within the peptide-binding groove. It is unlikely that DQA1*0505 functions as a disease-susceptibility allele whereas DQA1*0501 functions as a protective allele when they share such significant sequence homology at critical peptide-binding sites, diminishing the likelihood that these sequences are directly relevant in PV. Without direct sequencing data, it is difficult to confidently conclude that a valid positive or negative association of either DQA1*05 allele exists.   Thus, susceptibility to PV appears [MASK_NOLOSS]. Worldwide, DR4-associated PV maps predominantly to the DRB1*0402 allele, whereas responsibility for DR6-associated disease can be narrowed to DQB1*0503. It remains to be determined if the phenotypic spectrum and fine specificity of autoreactive T-cell populations in DR4 and DR6 individuals is overlapping or entirely distinct. Differences in the regulation of cytokines that induce the expression of MHC molecules or polymorphisms in antigen-processing enzymes may also contribute to the existence of two modes of PV induction. Similarly, the molecular basis for the persistent association in the Asian population with DRB1*0403 and *0406, alleles that are structurally distinct from *0402, awaits further elucidation through the development of allele-specific T-cell lines and associated self-epitopes. The functional consequences of HLA sequence polymorphisms may be best revealed by examining site-specific mutations within peptide binding pockets to determine if critical charge differences at relevant residues can alter the selection of self-epitopes and T-cell response.

Eight underrepresented alleles in Ashkenazi Jewish patients have been observed 39. Two of these alleles, DQA1*0101 and DQB1*0301, have been linked to disease development in prior studies. DRB1*1104, underrepresented in Ashkenazi Jewish population, was also negatively associated with disease in Iranian patients 41. However, Dsg-responsive, DRB1*1104-restricted T-cell clones have been reported in one study 67. The remaining five negatively associated alleles, DQB1*02, DRB1*0301, DRB1*07, DQA1*0501, and DQA1*0201, do not possess sequence polymorphisms that distinguishes them from either PV-associated or nonoPV associated alleles.

It was disheartening to see mean-spirited proposals like this pass even in a progressive state like Wisconsin.

Sekulow calls the Freedom From Religion Foundation\\'s case frivolous. I disagree, but even if frivolous cases are sometimes filed, that hardly justifies making it harder for everyone to get a case into the federal courts.

No one knows. </P> BUT WHAT [MASK_NOLOSS] condition? It turns out that when they hibernate, animals overcome what currently look to us like intractable medical problems. For instance, cold-temperature hibernators, such as bats and ground squirrels, put themselves through rigors that would kill us. Most mammals that don't hibernate -- such as mice, rats, and humans -- die of heart failure if you cool the heart below about 70 degrees. Similarly, the hibernating brain gets almost no oxygen, yet the animal doesn't suffer brain damage. Understanding how that works could lead to better treatments for stroke and head trauma. </P> Indeed, ground squirrels have much to teach about brain regeneration. Studies of the golden-mantled ground squirrel show that during hibernation they retract many of their dendrites -- the tendril-like nerve-cell endings that receive information from other neurons. Such a disappearance of dendrites is usually associated with senility. Yet each time the animal rouses, though it's only for a few hours, it regrows its dendrites. What's more, the dendrites grow faster when [MASK_NOLOSS] development -- a period usually thought to be the pinnacle of speedy neural growth.

Again, the answer isn't clear. One possibility, favored by the hibernation expert H. Craig Heller, a professor of biological sciences at Stanford University, is that during hibernation, it is too difficult to properly maintain the dendrites, so it's better to get rid of them and start over than to have to repair them. In support of that idea, he and his colleagues have shown that retraction is more extensive in animals that get colder.

Chicken miRNAs, 122 homologs, were identified in the analysis of the chicken genome ( ICGSC 2004 ) by comparison with other species.

Studies on microRNAs in comparative bird development will help to refine our understanding of these molecules. Subtractive suppression hybridization and macroarrays. Wang and colleagues ( 2006b ) used the subtractive suppression hybridization ( SSH ) technique ( box 1 ) to identify house finch genes that responded to infection by a bacterium, Mycoplasma gallisepticum ( MG ), and that might therefore undergo MG-driven natural selection. They constructed two subtractive cDNA libraries, one made of clones found to be up-regulated in the spleen of MG-infected birds relative to controls, and a second of clones found to be up-regulated in the spleen of healthy birds relative to MG-infected ones. A total of 220 cDNA clones, consisting of 34 genes with known homologues and novel transcripts, were found to be [MASK_NOLOSS] Putative gene expression changes were subsequently confirmed by high-throughout reverse northern blot hybridizations ( see \" Macroarrays \" in box 1 ).

Complementary DNA microarrays can allow the identification of previously unknown genes and pathways whose expression correlate with a specific phenotype. Abzhanov and colleagues ( 2006 ) designed a microarray using a cDNA library constructed from RNA isolated from the embryonic frontonasal processes of one of Darwin's finches, G. fortis. The goal of the study was to identify new genetic pathways involved in Darwin's finch beak morphogenesis by comparing gene expression profiles between species belonging to a monophyletic group but exhibiting distinct beak morphology--that is, variation in beak depth, width [MASK_NOLOSS]. Individual microarray slides were hybridized with embryonic frontonasal primordia RNA from five species of Darwin's finches and a common reference of several individuals belonging to a basal species, G. difficilis.

In addition, participants were asked about their relationship with the network member ( for [MASK_NOLOSS] ), length of relationship, satisfaction with relationship, physical distance or proximity ( for example, live together, live within same neighborhood ), frequency of contact ( for example, daily or weekly ), if this person knows they are HIV-positive and if so who told them. For this project, the disclosure rate of each target group ( that is, immediate family, extended family, and friends ) was calculated by dividing the number of people disclosed to by the total number of people in the network. Immediate family members included parents, siblings, and spouses related by blood, marriage, or adoption. Participants reported on average three immediate family members ( SD = 2.4 ), with an average of 69 percent of them being told of the diagnosis. Extended family members included all people related by blood, marriage, or adoption. Participants averaged one extended family member ( SD = 1.5 ), with an average of 42 percent of them being told of the diagnosis. Participants also reported an average [MASK_NOLOSS] an average of 52 percent of them being told of the diagnosis. Participants were also asked about additional family members not mentioned during the ASSIS interview. For example, \" You mentioned your mother, what about your father? \" Participants would then report whether their father was perhaps deceased or not active in their life. Consequences of disclosure were measured with an 18-item ( Serovich, 2001 ) instrument. Participants were asked how important each possible consequence concerning disclosure was to them when considering each specific person. Consequences were categorized into 10 reward ( a =.87 ) and eight cost ( a =.86 ) items. For example, fear of being blamed for contracting HIV after disclosing to that person was a negative consequence, whereas believing that disclosing would bring the relationship closer was a positive consequence.

Chi-square statistics, root mean square error of approximation ( RMSEA ), comparative fit index ( CFI ), and goodness of fit index ( GFI ) were used to evaluate goodness of fit. For all tests the level of significance was set at p =.05. We began by specifying the disease progression model in which disease progression is a predictor of disclosure. Then the consequences model was examined by testing the relationship among disease progression, consequences, and disclosure. It was expected that consequences of disclosure would mediate the relationship between disease progression and [MASK_NOLOSS] likelihood estimation assumes that the observed variables follow a multivariate normal distribution.

To indicate good fit, CFI and GFI are expected to be above 0.95 ( Hu &; Bender, 1995 ), Although the disease progression model appeared to be an acceptable model based on the values of model fit indices, attention to the parameter estimates showed an irregularity. That is, an examination of the structural model revealed that the parameter estimates for viral load and CD4 T-cell count to disclosure were nonsignificant ( = -0.01, t = -.58 ; = 0.00, t = -1.37, respectively ).

This suggests that although disease progression is not a precursor to consequences, consequences ( especially expected reward of disclosure ) are predictive of disclosure.Revised Consequences Model Because disease progression did not significantly contribute to either model, the consequences model was analyzed omitting the path of disease progression to consequences ( see Figure 1 ).

This suggests that the final model best explained that the evaluation of disclosure and perceived consequences is a precursor of disclosure.DISCUSSION The results of this study support an earlier claim that disease progression may not be a direct precursor of HIV disclosure ( Serovich, 2001 ). Historically, the progression of HIV disease has been unambiguous : contracting HIV meant an early death, Because of this, many women may have experienced a pressing need to settle personal matters quickly, which necessitated disclosure. For women to conceal all HIV diagnosis from [MASK_NOLOSS] been difficult. Currently however, advanced therapies have changed the progression of HIV, with many women living longer, healthier, and more productive lives. Hence, with early detection and proper medical attention, disease progression may not play as pivotal a role in women\\'s disclosure decisions. In addition, as the general public becomes more educated and accepting of HIV infection, the potential rewards of disclosure may outweigh the potential costs. Other plausible explanations for the lack of support for the relationship between disease progression and disclosure could be argued. First, there is considerable variability in which disease progression has been measured in earlier studies ( Mansergh, Marks, &; Simoni, 1995 ; Marks, Bundek, et al., 1992 ). Indices of disease progression such as symptom severity, CD4 T-cell counts, number of opportunistic infections, and time since diagnosis may not be measuring \" disease progression \" as previously conceptualized. In fact, it is equally plausible that what is being measured is the degree to which women experience heightened [MASK_NOLOSS] be a methodological or theoretical problem in the assumption that a woman\\'s medical condition at one point in time is related to the cumulative measurement of her disclosure.

In fact, it is equally plausible that what is being measured is the degree to which women experience heightened [MASK_NOLOSS] be a methodological or theoretical problem in the assumption that a woman\\'s medical condition at one point in time is related to the cumulative measurement of her disclosure. Future researchers should be cautious in the interpretation of such data. The results of this study support a consequences-based model of HIV disclosure, which suggests that women may evaluate the rewards and costs of disclosure to family and friends before it occurs. Unfortunately, how this processing occurs, how rewards and costs are weighed, who is involved, and how to intervene in this process were not considered in this study and are yet to be fully understood. There may be, however, some indication of the important items to be considered by examining Table 2. For women, the most frequently reported rewards for disclosing their HIV status appeared to be other and not self-oriented. For example, priority rewards focused on the concern for other\\'s safety ( that is, \" Keep them safe from HIV, \" and \" They had a right to know \" ) [MASK_NOLOSS] frequently reported rewards for disclosure were self-oriented. These rewards focused more on the woman\\'s own instrumental needs ( that is, \" Person could be prepared to assist me \" ) or expressive needs ( \" I could blow off steam \" ). This is further supported by an examination of the most frequently reported costs for disclosing. Concerns about negative communications that might follow disclosure ( that is, \" Person would lecture me \" ) were predominant, whereas less frequently endorsed costs for disclosure were about the relationship ( that is, \" Person would not want to be around me, \" and \" Might lose the relationship \" ). Although it is altruistic that women view those to whom they disclose as needing the reformation to either heighten their awareness of HIV or out of obligation because of familial or emotional ties, the other focus is worrisome as it might lead to a minimization of their own needs. If women approach disclosure with that attitude of \" you need this information, \" this could result in a [MASK_NOLOSS] situation well.

Radiation therapy, although a controversial option, maybe useful for reducing tumor growth in elderly or debilitated patients, but it may change tumor biology. Cole and Beiler describe a case of radiation-induced malignancy occurring after the treatment of benign jugular foramen tumor. ( n5 ) Complete tumor removal by microsurgical techniques is the treatment of choice. Schwannomas and meningiomas are the next most common jugular foramen tumors. ( n1 ) Schwannomas arise from Schwann cells in the nerve sheath. Meningiomas in this region arise from arachnoid cells in the jugular bulb. ( n6 ) Like paragangliomas, most of these lesions are benign. Patients can present with hearing loss and lower cranial nerve deficits if tumors are of sufficient size. In one series of jugular foramen tumors, all patients with meningiomas of the jugular foramen presented with lower cranial nerve [MASK_NOLOSS] are rare. Ramina et al reported only 4 cases in a series of 102 jugular foramen tumors.

In the head and neck, these tumors are generally classified into group I ( showing epithelial differentiation ) and group II ( showing primarily neural features ). Group I tumors include well-differentiated, moderately differentiated, and poorly differentiated ( small-cell type and large-cell type ) NECs and pituitary adenomas/carcinomas. Group II tumors include granular cell tumors, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, malignant melanomas, neurofibromas, olfactory neuroblastomas, paragangliomas, schwannomas, and peripheral neuroectodermal tumors.

Her primary concern was the disfiguring effect of the nodularity, particularly on the left side of her face. She reported no pain, and she exhibited no signs of facial nerve weakness. Her medical, surgical, family, and social history was unremarkable, and all her laboratory tests, including a screen for human immunodeficiency virus, were negative. Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) of the parotid areas had been obtained earlier by the [MASK_NOLOSS] that demonstrated variable intensity on T2 weighting ( figure 1 ). Physical examination revealed that the nodules were firm and nontender, and they were indeed more prominent on the left. The patient's neck was free of lymphadenopathy. Figure 1. Preoperative MRI shows the nodules ( asterisks ) in both parotid areas. Routine posteroanterior and lateral chest x-rays were normal. Fine-needle aspiration was performed at multiple nodular sites ; cytology consistently demonstrated a uniform oncocytic population of cells with no significant cytologic atypia. This finding was consistent with a bilateral oncocytic lesion ( differential diagnosis : hyperplastic vs. neoplastic lesion ). The patient underwent superficial parotid resections, and the parotid bed was reconstructed with AlloDerm. The patient recovered from surgery without facial nerve weakness or any other complication. Gross examination of the resected parotid tissues revealed fragmented nodular pieces of soft brown and tan tissue. Serial sectioning of the tissue fragments revealed discrete round nodules that ranged in size from 0.2 to 2.5 cm ( figure 2 ). Each nodule was pink-tan to brown throughout. [MASK_NOLOSS] was noted in one of the larger nodules. Figure 2. Sections of different levels of the resected parotid tissues show obvious nodule formations. Well-defined fibrous capsules surround some of the larger nodules ( asterisks ). Also note the macrocyst formations ( arrows ). Microscopic examination of the tissue revealed multiple foci of oncocytic cell aggregates in nodule formations scattered among normal parotid tissue ( figure 3 ). The oncocytic cells, 10 to 15 m in diameter, showed the usual morphology : an abundant, finely granular eosinophilic cytoplasm and centrally placed round nuclei with prominent nucleoli and slight nuclear pleomorphism ( figure 4, A ).

Some of the cells exhibited clear-cell morphology, although the location of the clear-cell nuclei was more peripheral ( figure 4, B ) than what is typically seen in oncocytic morphology, in which the nuclei are centrally placed. The cells were arranged in solid, organoid, and trabecular patterns ; thin fibrous stroma and blood vessels separated the trabecular and organoid forms. Many of the nodule formations blended imperceptibly with [MASK_NOLOSS] intervening fibrous tissue formation ; these formations had a more irregular outline ( figure 4, C ). The larger, more dominant nodules were contained in well-defined, well-circumscribed fibrous capsules that separated them from the surrounding tissues ( figure 4, D ). No entrapped normal parotid gland elements were observed. It is interesting that these encapsulated nodules also exhibited more of a solid pattern of growth and occasional cyst formation. It thus became evident that there were two patterns of growth--hyperplastic and neoplastic. The hyperplastic pattern was characterized by the unencapsulated nodular growth pattern and irregular outline. The neoplastic pattern was characterized by the well-encapsulated, round, solid nodules.

On the basis of the cytologic features, we made a diagnosis of multiple bilateral multinodular oncocytomas of the parotid glands arising in a background of multifocal nodular oncocytic hyperplasia. The patient was followed in our outpatient clinic, and at 4 years postoperatively, she exhibited no evidence of recurrence.Discussion Cells with oncocytic morphology have been described in many organ systems throughout the body ( e.g., kidney, thyroid, and breast ) since they were first observed by Schaffer in 1897 in tissues from the upper aerodigestive tract. ( n11 ) Within the salivary glands, the appearance of these cells in focal metaplastic, hyperplastic, or neoplastic oncocytic processes is usually related to increasing age. [MASK_NOLOSS] decades of life ; rarely are they encountered in patients younger than 50 years. ( n4, n12, n13 ) It is not entirely clear whether the development of oncocytic neoplasia ( benign oncocytoma/oncocytic carcinomas ) is a discrete independent event or if it occurs along a continuum of oncocytic metaplasia/hyperplasia that ultimately leads to a neoplastic change. As is the case with many other well-researched pathologic events, it is reasonable to theorize that both scenarios may be in play. More research is certainly needed to clarify this point. Etiologic factors that may trigger neoplastic change include radiation exposure, metabolic mitochondrial defects, and genetic predispositions. In this regard, Brandwein and Huvos(n1) found a history of radiation exposure in some of their cases, and Becker et al(n14) described an age-dependent intracellular metabolic defect associated with mitochondriopathy as an explanation for the development of oncocytosis in 2 of their cases. However, the pathogenesis of the proposed continuum ( **30;8272;TOOLONG change ) remains largely undefined. Most investigators agree with the World Health Organization',\n",
       " \"[YEAR:2008] thyroid goiter. ( n1 ) Most authors do agree that the microscopic differentiation between a hyperplastic oncocytic nodule and a tumoral nodule ( benign oncocytoma ) is based primarily on the presence or absence of a well-defined fibrous capsule that encompasses the tumor completely or at least partially and separates it from the surrounding tissues. Hyperplastic nodules usually do not feature this encapsulation ; they have an irregular outline that blends into the circumferential tissues with no fibrous barrier, and they tend to be lobular rather than lobar. ( n15-n17 ) Also, parotid oncocytomas tend to be easily detectable clinically because their size typically ranges from 1 to 7 cm, which is larger than most of the nodules seen in MNOH. As a result, patients are more likely to seek medical evaluation. The parotid gland is by far the most common site of salivary gland oncocytomas ( 85 to 90% of cases ). ( n15, n16 ) These neoplasms usually present as a single mass that involves only one parotid gland. Bilateral parotid gland [MASK_NOLOSS] tumors of any kind are unusual ; Warthin's tumor is the most common. To date, bilateral oncocytomas have been seen only in the parotid gland. ( n1, n6-n10 ) Gnepp et al, in a review of bilateral salivary gland neoplasms published in 1989, documented 12 cases of bilateral oncocytomas in the world literature and found that they occurred as synchronous or metachronous events. ( n6 ) Some authors also reported the multinodular fashion by which some oncocytomas present and warned against interpreting the multinodularity as a sign of malignancy. ( n18, n19 ) In the report by Brandwein and Huvos, who studied 68 oncocytic lesions of the major salivary glands, the incidence of bilateral oncocytomas was 7%. ( n1 ) These authors found that bilateral presentations correlated with significant clear-cell change. Ellis reviewed 10 cases of clear-cell oncocytomas and found that clear-cell change occurred secondary to glycogen accumulation ; however, mitochondria were still the preponderant intracytoplasmic organelle, as they are in typical oncocytomas.

( n1, n2 ) Numerous underlying conditions predispose patients to this infection, including diabetic ketoacidosis and immunodeficiency conditions that give rise to acidosis and uremia ; it is also seen in patients who undergo [MASK_NOLOSS], and disseminated cancer. ( n2 ) Although Down syndrome is an immunodeficiency condition, fungal infection is rare in these patients. In the past, only laryngeal candidiasis involving vestibular folds has been described in Down syndrome patients. ( n4 ) There are several forms of mucormycosis : rhinocerebral, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, and disseminated. Most cases of head and neck infection involve the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. Oral manifestations are characterized by a necrotic ulcer of the hard palate, alveolar margins, lips, cheeks, or mandible and a characteristic black eschar on the mucosa. ( n5-n7 ) Oftentimes, the first clinical manifestations of infection are facial cellulitis, nasal discharge, fever, and headache ; affected patients may also present with a perforated hard palate. Another characteristic feature of mucormycosis is the propensity of fungal hyphae to attach to arterial walls, which can result in hematogenous spread, ischemia, infarction, and the appearance of black necrotic lesions. ( n2 ) Thus, wherever it occurs, mucormycosis is associated with high rates of morbidity [MASK_NOLOSS] palatal necrosis, facial swelling, nasal discharge, and fever was very unusual.

( n12 ) The investigators stressed the importance of not using wooden tongue depressors in the ICU. -- In Sweden, Rhizopus infections have been seen in sawmill workers exposed to mold-infested wood who had high titers of precipitating antibodies to R microsporus. ( n13 ) We suspect that our immunodeficient patient was subjected to repeated oral examinations with disposable wooden spatulas used as tongue depressors and that this exposure was the source of her mucormycosis. Once we realized this possibility, we took immediate action to halt the use of wooden tongue depressors as examination tools and limb splints. Managers and nursing staff in the neonatal unit were advised to use only sterilized metallic spatulas and to take extra care when examining the oral cavity of immunosuppressed children.

Aural fullness and hearing loss are also common in patients with this disease because of the accumulation of fungal debris in the ear canal.   Many authors have reported the identification of Aspergillus isolates in specimens obtained from the ears of patients with otomycosis. ( n1-n4 ) Vennewald et al studied fungal colonization of the ear in 128 immunocompetent patients supposed to suffer from otomycosis. n5 Patients with chronic otitis media, with or without cholesteatoma, comprised the largest group in this study. The researchers argued that the predominance of Aspergillus and Candida spp is related to the inflammatory process of the ears   In patients with otitis media, persistent discharge with maceration of epithelium may support fungal colonization of the external ear. The presence of conidiophores in the auditory canal suggests that the fungi use the discharged mucus as a nutrient.   The inflammation caused by chronic hyperplasia of the mucous membrane in the middle ear can be compared with inflammation in the upper respiratory tract. ( [MASK_NOLOSS], increased mucus production, inhibition of mucociliary clearance, chronically inflamed mucosa with lymphocytic and plasma-cell inflammation, and fibrosis.

Infection by molds, in contrast to that caused by bacteria and yeasts, usually occurs in the presence of tympanic perforation. In immunocompetent patients this is a rare event, but in immunocompromised patients, in whom this occurs more frequently, it is important that the treatment of otomycosis be prompt and vigorous in order to minimize the likelihood of hearing loss and invasive temporal bone infection.

Advocates of teaching uncontracted braille to adults assumed that during initial learning, sequential tactile [MASK_NOLOSS] introduction of braille contractions, whereas advocates of teaching contracted braille assumed that learning uncontracted braille was superfluous for former print readers because of their existing body of print knowledge, the availability of reading materials in contracted braille, and the early learning of logographic ( whole-word ) sentences to maintain interest and increase the reading rate ( Tobin, 1971 ).   There is conflicting evidence as to whether teaching adults to read braille should begin with enlarged braille cells ( like a braillette board or a giant cell ) before progressing to standard-sized braille cells ( Tobin, 1971, 1988 ; Tobin, Burton, Davies, &; Guggenheim, 1986 ). The majority ( 53% ) of the teachers in Tobin's ( 1971 ) survey began instruction with large- or expanded-cell braille, and 47% began instruction with standardsized braille. In contrast, 60% of the instructors in Ponchillia and Durant's ( 1995 ) study reported using large-cell braille or other tactile codes to fewer than 1 in 10 clients. The most important reason why instructors begin teaching adults [MASK_NOLOSS] of the digits and hands in vertical, horizontal, and circular directions for learning to read ( Millar, 1997a ; Tobin et al., 1986 ).

The feasibility of learning braille in adulthood has been shown with diabetic clients who had impaired tactile sensitivity and discriminated braille well enough for functional use in daily life ( Harley, Pichert, &; Morrison, 1985 ). In contrast to adults who are learning braille, the main reason for not beginning the instruction of braille in an enlarged format when teaching children was that the eventual changeover to a regular braille format would require relearning the sounds of the characters, and it would take as long or longer to relearn the characters in the regular format as to learn the regular format from the beginning ( Millar, [MASK_NOLOSS] print readers to learn braille involved self-instruction with tape recorded presentations and brailled texts.

When hydrogen is concentrated, it is usual for two hydrogen elements to join by sharing their electrons and form H2 gas ( Ewing, 2007 ).

       " '[YEAR:2009]Cell division is necessary to the building of a soma from the single-celled zygote during development, as well as the sine qua non, in the form of meiosis, for the evolutionary success of species. Here we review recent progress in our understanding of a key player, the kinetochore, in these processes. The kinetochore is both the anchor to the mitotic spindle for chromosomes at division and the motor for distribution of chromosomal units to daughter cells. In addition, the kinetochore plays a key role in the molecular checkpoints of cell-cycle progression. Although the nucleation of the kinetochore at a chromosomal site is under epigenetic control, the underlying base sequence of the DNA at the centromere is not critical : The assembly of the kinetochore occurs at exactly the same place on the same chromosomes at every division cycle. We discuss recent advances in our understanding of how the kinetochore is organized and assembled, as well as how it contributes to critical cell-cycle checkpoints and to chromosome movement. Keywords : kinetochore ; molecular methods ; history of the kinetochore ; mitosis Cell division is a cornerstone [MASK_NOLOSS] a body, the soma, and for the gametes necessary to produce the next generation. In this review, we focus on a critical component of karyokinesis, the partitioning of the genome contained in the nucleus. This is accomplished by the mitotic spindle, a highly conserved feature of karyokinesis in the cells of multitudes of organisms that have been examined by light or electron microscopy. After 125 years of study, we know much about the \" mitotic machine, \" but as we hope to demonstrate here, much remains to be discovered. To the continual bafflement of many, both the terms \" centromere \" and \" kinetochore \" are used for, variously, the constriction in chromosomes that marks the location of spindle attachment, the underlying DNA base sequence at this site, the heterochromatin observable at this location in many organisms, and the multiprotein complex that provides attachment to the spindle and the motor molecules that move the chromosomes at anaphase. To be clear, we define the kinetochore as a highly conserved structure localized [MASK_NOLOSS]. 2000 ). When we use the term \" centromere, \" we mean the underlying base sequence at this site, and we are aware, of the irony that this structure ( by definition ) can not be seen in the light',\n",

In vertebrates, kinetochores appear soon after the nuclear envelope breaks down, and the cell enters prometaphase. Microtubules connect with kinetochores, and the ball-and-cup structure begins to differentiate into a plate-like structure. The corona is then observable until the microtubules bind, after which it is less visible. By late [MASK_NOLOSS] The kinetochore plate remains visible until the nuclear envelop re-forms in telophase ( Maiato and Sunkel 2004 ). A diverse group of organisms, from diatoms to humans, has kinetochores that are trilaminar in structure, but not all kinetochores fit this description ( Wise 1988, Brinkley 1990 ). Insects and higher plants have a ball-and-cup kinetochore ( Rufas et al. 1994 ). Even so, Maiato and colleagues ( 2006 ) argued that the kinetochores of Drosophila, an insect, are very similar to those of vertebrates. Microtubule attachment to kinetochores was first observed in detail using TEM ( Brinkley and Stubblefield 1966 ). Kinetochore fibers ( K-fibers ) are bundles of microtubules that connect to kinetochores. There appears to be a rough correlation between evolutionary complexity and the number of kinetochore microtubules. The budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has one microtubule attached to the kinetochore, whereas the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, has two to four ; Drosophila melanogaster has four to six ; and mammals have 20 or more microtubules.

This finding indicates that the fibers are more stable in later mitotic stages than in earlier stages ( McEwen et al. 1997 ), and leads to the notion of kinetochore maturation, the idea that kinetochores become more stable as mitosis progresses. Major technological advances such as the discovery of restriction endonucleases, recombinant DNA technology, and advanced confocal laser scanning microscopy have revolutionized the study of mitosis ( Macgregor 1993 ). The merger of modern technology with microscopic techniques has enabled researchers to ask questions that had not been possible before. Here, we detail some of the results relevant to kinetochore structure and function. Centromeric DNA Centromeric DNA cloning and sequencing techniques are complex, and will not be detailed in this review [MASK_NOLOSS] and protein function is an important point, and thus is covered briefly ( for a review, see Carroll and Straight 2006 ). The kinetochore forms in the same location on each chromosome at each mitotic event. However, the location is not always determined by the specific DNA sequence. In budding yeast, the centromeric sequence is 125 base pairs ( bp ) in length, divided into three domains ( Fitzgerald-Hayes et al. 1982 ). These sequences are not chromosome specific ; sequences can be switched between chromosomes to no ill effect. Carbon and Clarke ( 1984 ) altered the nucleotide sequence of the DNA surrounding the centromere of yeast chromosome III and found that domains two and three are necessary for normal centromere function. Therefore, a specific region is required for segregation. The fission yeast contains a central nonrepetitive region, flanked by centromere-specific innermost repeats that form the site of kinetochore assembly ( Carroll and Straight 2006 ). Surrounding this central domain are long, tandem arrays of outer repeats, common to all centromeres [MASK_NOLOSS] to 100 kilobase pairs. No single DNA sequence is necessary for kinetochore assembly, indicating an epigenetic mechanism. How these factors work is not yet evident. Centromeres of',\n",

Maxfield wrote that teachers who reported using the word method for teaching reading were also proponents of introducing contracted braille in the first grade. The state of instruction was not to remain the same for long, however, because the braille code was already changing. As early as 1929, only 12 years after they settled on a uniform code, educators in the United States once again discussed revising the code to add more contractions, bringing it in greater agreement with the code that was used in Great Britain. For example, the Kansas State School for the Blind, on discovering that most of its high school students used British braille, had decided in 1927 to start teaching some contractions earlier, in the second grade, although it did not advocate [MASK_NOLOSS], 1932 ). Recognizing the popularity of Grade 2 braille, AFB conducted a study to compare Grade 1-1/2 with Grade 2 braille ( Irwin &; Wilcox, 1929 ). The study examined which contractions saved the most space, which showed up most frequently in text samples, and which did the most to \" facilitate \" reading and writing. Among the findings were that certain contractions, such as those in the lower part of the braille cell, were easy to confuse with similar \" upper-cell \" contractions ( for example, have and his ). In addition, although Grade 2 braille saved approximately 12% space overall compared to Grade 1-1/2, certain contractions saved more space because they were used more frequently. For example, there were 10 Grade 2 contractions that would increase space savings from 9.42% to 12.46%. By contrast, the contraction for the word yourselves ( written in Grade 2 as the short-form word yrvs ) saved five spaces, but was used so infrequently that the advantages of adopting it were questionable. Some [MASK_NOLOSS] 2 contractions to the existing American code ( Irwin &; Wilcox, 1929 ), but the authors of the study suggested that a joint committee representing England and the United States could come to some compromises that would facilitate the sharing of braille materials between the two countries. The joint conference was held in London in July 1932, with representatives from AAWB and AAIB and their counterparts in England, to discuss the adoption of a uniform code for all English-speaking countries. The countries came to an agreement to adopt standard English braille even though there were still differences between the codes as used in the two countries ( Bogart, 2000 ;',\n",
       " '[YEAR:2009], 1986 ). Because incubators were a new technology, the effects of oxygen on premature infants were not yet understood. A large number of babies who were incubated developed retrolental fibroplasia ( RLF ), now referred to as retinopathy of prematurity ( ROP ), and many became blind or had severe low vision. These \" RLF babies \" entered school in the 1950s and 1960s. Suddenly, there was a great need for more research on best practices for teaching children who were visually impaired. Ashcroft ( 1960 ) conducted a study with 728 braille readers in Grades 2-6 that examined their errors in oral braille reading. He found that 90% of the students\\'errors fell into one of [MASK_NOLOSS] dots ), braille cell orientation ( such as reversals of symbols ), and memory ( such as association errors ). From his findings, Ashcroft made several recommendations regarding braille teaching methods, materials, and possible revisions to the code itself. One significant finding was that instructional materials in print that were then put into braille often did not provide enough repetition of vocabulary for children to remember braille symbols and their meanings. Ashcroft recommended that teachers create materials to provide more practice in the use of contractions, but that materials should consist of \" phrases, short idea units, or short sentences \" ( p. 86 ). Furthermore, he cautioned that materials should be provided at the \" appropriate difficulty levels \" ( p. 87 ) and that materials, including many multiple-cell contractions, short-form words, and lower cell contractions, seemed to cause great difficulty for children. Nolan and Kederis ( 1969 ) reported the results of a series of nine studies related to braille reading. Their findings indicated that the braille character was [MASK_NOLOSS], character recognition needs to be combined with word recognition in beginning formal braille instruction. Their other results reinforced the careful selection of an appropriate reading vocabulary. Certain braille configurations, such as lower cell signs, once again were found to be more difficult to differentiate than other symbols. Nolan and Kederis advocated for the constant monitoring of braille character-recognition skills and the prompt remediation of errors, which, they deduced, would increase reading speed and fluency as the child gets older and gains more experience. Lowenfeld, Abel, and Hatlen ( 1969 ) examined the evidence related to instruction in braille reading and writing and how children learn braille through the \" whole-word \" method, then in wide use.

Over the next 8 months, he returned on five occasions to work a 24-hour shift in a clinic located approximately one-half block from Ground Zero. This area had been declared a safety zone in which the use of a respirator was not required. During the 1 to 2 years prior to his WTC exposure, the nurse had occasionally experienced sinus congestion and heartburn. These symptoms were relieved with saline irrigation, diet management, and weight loss, and they posed no restriction on his daily activity. Following exposure to Ground Zero, his sinonasal and GERD symptoms intensified. He also developed hoarseness, a nonproductive cough, and significant throat-clearing. The patient was evaluated in our office with strobovideolaryngoscopy and diagnosed with a posterior vocal process granuloma, a lesion that is causally associated with LPR ( figure 2 ). He was placed on a twice-daily proton-pump inhibitor and a 2-week course of a high-dose oral steroid. When he returned for follow-up [MASK_NOLOSS] Figure 2. Patient 2. The posterior vocal process granuloma is seen on strobovideolaryngoscopy.

No foreign particulate matter was seen in the specimen, and there was a lack of giant-cell reaction and nonpolarizable elements. One year later, the patient returned with recurrent hoarseness and coughing while continuing to take a high dose of his proton-pump inhibitor.

Our patient had a thick, irregular capsule with indefinite capsular interruption in some areas.

Otherwise, his medical history was significant for Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia, which had been treated with oral imatinib. Physical examination revealed left-sided proptosis with periorbital edema and erythema and a left-sided cranial nerve VI palsy. Endoscopic examination of the nasal cavity detected a homogeneous, nonpulsatile, nonulcerated mass between the left middle turbinate and the nasal septum that appeared to be superiorly based. Computed tomography ( CT ) and magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) identified a soft-tissue mass that involved the entire left nasal cavity, the ethmoid and frontal sinuses, and part of the right ethmoid cavity ( figure 1 ). Bony erosion of the anterior cribriform plate and left lamina papyracea was also noted on review of the films. Figure 1. A : Noncontrast CT of the paranasal sinuses shows the left sinonasal mass.

In fact, one study found that 26 of 27 cases were correctly diagnosed on fine-needle aspiration ; the lone nondiagnostic case was subsequently diagnosed as a granulocytic sarcoma on open biopsy. n17 Cytogenetic analysis of the tumor and bone marrow may aid in the confirmation of a presumptive diagnosis when immunohistochemical studies produce conflicting results or when bone marrow involvement in leukemia lags behind peripheral manifestations. n18 While the diagnosis in our case was aided by our knowledge of the patient's history of chronic myelogenous leukemia, it may not be as easily reached in patients who lack any history of known hematologic abnormalities.

Occasionally there is dysphagia, pain, or dyspnea, and in some cases patients are asymptomatic and the lesion is discovered incidentally. Acute stridor, as occurred in our patient, is extremely rare. The treatment of choice for an oncocytic lesion is complete endoscopic excision or, if necessary, laryngofissure. A partial laryngectomy is occasionally required. All patients require follow-up to look for potential recurrence. n1 The concomitant pulmonary tuberculosis in our patient raised the possibility of tuberculous laryngeal involvement, but the definitive diagnosis and management were achieved following endoscopic removal of the cyst.

None of the studies that focused on braille reading difficulties has specifically measured verbal short-term memory or analyzed its relationship to the reading skill of children in braille below the age-expected level. Verbal short-term memory has been shown to be one of the unique predictors of literacy development ( Boets et al., 2008 ). Therefore, the relationship between verbal short-term memory and other predictors of literacy development should be studied thoroughly in individuals who are visually impaired. The role of tactile processing Tactile processing substitutes for visual processing in reading in individuals with visual impairments. Several studies have demonstrated that adults who are blind perform better on different tactile tasks than do those who are sighted ( Grant, Thiagarajah, &; Sathian, 2000 ; Van Boven et al., 2000 ). The superior performance, however, [MASK_NOLOSS] Van Boven et al., 2000 ). That is, reading braille improves the tactile sensitivity of the reading finger by expanding the processing area on the somatosensory cortex ( Van Boven et al., 2000 ). Furthermore, people who are sighted can reach the tactile performance of persons who are blind through training ( Grant et al., 2000 ). Grant et al. ( 1999 ) used gratings of alternating ridges and grooves to investigate tactile perception in dyslexia. Compared to individuals in the control group, persons with dyslexia were significantly impaired on the discrimination of grating orientation, with mean thresholds that were nearly twice as high as normal. Further support for previous findings came from Stoodley et al. ( 2000 ), who examined the domain of somatosensory perception in adults with a prior history of dyslexia compared to similarly aged adults in a control group. The detection thresholds for three frequencies of vibration ( 3Hz, 30 Hz, and 100 Hz ) were obtained. Individuals with dyslexia were significantly less sensitive to vibration at [MASK_NOLOSS] I ( SAI ) fiber system beginning with Merkel-cell mechanoreceptors in the glabrous skin. The same SAI fibers with Merkel receptors are responsible for the recognition and processing of braille characters ( Phillips, Johansson, &; Johnson, 1990 ). Arter ( 1998 ) studied children with visual impairments who were struggling to learn to read braille and found that 10 of the 12 experienced problems with tactile perception.

Hailey ( from the case study presented in Greaney &; Reason, 1999 ) also seemed to have difficulties with tactile perception. Conclusion The literacy development of children who are visually impaired is highly dependent on the children's caretakers and teachers who are responsible for compensating for the absence of spontaneous interaction with written language. A child with many interesting and stimulating experiences of books and reading is likely to be more motivated to acquire a complicated reading medium, such as braille, than is a child who does not even know that oral language can be written down ( Erickson &; Hatton, 2007 ). Studies that have compared individuals who [MASK_NOLOSS] the latter are slower readers than are skilled sighted persons who read print. This difference, however, is due more to the tactile process of reading braille than to any major differences in orthographic or phonological processing ( Barlow-Brown &; Connelly, 2002 ). The main information-processing tasks in reading are essentially the same irrespective of whether the input stimulus is visual or tactile ( Pring, 1984 ). As in the sighted population, a proportion of individuals with visual impairments are unable to master the skill of reading despite remedial efforts ( Arter, 1998 ). Limited data on problematic braille reading have shown that persons with visual impairments who struggle with reading also have difficulties with phonological awareness ( Gillon &; Young, 2002 ) and tactile perception ( Arter, 1998 ; Greaney &; Reason, 1999 ). The temporal-processing deficit theory of dyslexia assumes that there are deficits in both these domains. The theory hypothesizes that the deficit in perceiving auditory temporal cues causes a problem for the accurate detection of rapid acoustical changes in speech and consequently [MASK_NOLOSS] Witton, 2002 ). It has been demonstrated that children with dyslexia have higher thresholds than do those without dyslexia for auditory temporal processing ( Boets et al., 2008 ; Van Ingelghem et al., 2001 )\",\n",

It has been demonstrated that children with dyslexia have higher thresholds than do those without dyslexia for auditory temporal processing ( Boets et al., 2008 ; Van Ingelghem et al., 2001 ). Furthermore, temporal-processing measures are significantly related to word and nonword reading in children both with and without dyslexia ( Van Ingelghem et al., 2001 ). The temporal-processing deficit has also been shown to affect visual ( Stein &; Walsh, 1997 ) and tactile sensitivity ( Stoodley et al., 2000 ) in persons with dyslexia. The decreased tactile sensitivity to vibration at 3 Hz of persons with dyslexia suggests an impairment of the SAI fiber system beginning with Merkel-cell mechanoreceptors in the glabrous skin. The same SAI fibers with Merkel receptors are responsible for the recognition and processing of braille characters ( Phillips et al., 1990 ). In individuals who are visually impaired, the sense of touch has taken over the function of vision in the reading process. Therefore, a relationship similar to that seen in sighted individuals can [MASK_NOLOSS] who read braille. The limited amount of data from studies of children who have problems with braille reading seems to be compatible with observations that have been made in research on dyslexia. It could be the case that the neural deficit that is observed in dyslexia prevents a proportion of children with visual impairments from developing the tactile sensitivity that is necessary to decode braille and the auditory acuity that is needed to detect frequency modulation in speech, which underlie phonological awareness abilities and are necessary to tackle the partly logographic nature of braille orthography. Therefore, there is a need for extensive research on the relationships among different subskills of reading braille. Research on phonological awareness and orthographic measures could be extended to looking at psychophysical underpinnings ( low-level auditory and tactile processing ), which would give the field a new dimension in the consideration of the existence of braille dyslexia.

HLA-B27 antigen plays a role in several non-organ-specific autoimmune disease states, including ankylosing spondylitis, acute anterior uveitis, and Reiter syndrome.

Introduction One of the most significant technological issues of the 21st Century is finding a way to fulfill our energy demands without destroying the environment through global warming and climate change. Worldwide human population is on the rise, and with it, the demand for more energy in pursuit of a higher quality of life. In the meantime, as we use up our fossil fuel energy supplies, the quality of our environment is diminishing. By finding a way to provide clean, sustainable, environmentally friendly energy, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help reverse the negative trends afflicting our planet ( Sweet, 2006 ). One very promising technology that is currently being utilized and is continually being improved is the hydrogen fuel cell ( HFC ). It is an energy-conversion device that converts hydrogen fuel into usable electricity. HFC technology has the potential to help satisfy the rapidly growing energy [MASK_NOLOSS] the quality of our environment. With this kind of potential, research and development in HFC technology continues to produce viable energy alternatives through the combined efforts of many scientists, engineers, and technologists ( Borowitz, 1999 ). The aim of this article is to provide an overview of HFC technology, and with it, a description of its simplicity in design and functionality. In addition, a rationale for HFC content and several strategies for teaching about this exciting technology are presented. What is a Hydrogen Fuel Cell? An HFC is an electrochemical device that acts to convert chemical energy directly into electrical energy. The entire electrochemical conversion process is accomplished cleanly and efficiently without the use of any moving parts. During the process, a fuel of hydrogen-rich compounds is converted into electricity in the form of direct current that can be used much like a battery, as long as the fuel is supplied to the cell. A combination of fuel cells can be connected in series or parallel circuits in order to increase electrical voltage [MASK_NOLOSS] parallel creates what is termed a fuel-cell stack. A variety of fuel cell designs are being pursued and developed for a wide variety of applications.

A variety of fuel cell designs are being pursued and developed for a wide variety of applications. Many of these designs have already been implemented and continue to gain acceptance as effective means of providing electrical power. The multitude of HFC designs are classified by the type of electrolyte that they employ. Electrolyte types determine how the HFC functions, specifically, the temperature range at which they operate, the catalysts they utilize, the fuel they require, and other factors upon which they depend ( USDOE, 2007 ; Hoogers, 2003 ). Of all currently utilized HFC designs, the Proton Exchange Membrane ( PEM ) fuel cell can serve as the focus of beginning HFC instruction, \" because of its simplicity, viability, quick start-up, and ability to be utilized in almost any conceivable application, from powering a cell phone to a locomotive \" ( Sammes, 2006, p. 27 ). The PEM fuel cell functions through the use of a specially designed and produced polymer [MASK_NOLOSS] of hydrogen fuel and oxygen ( Basu, 2007 ; Hoogers, 2003 ; Sammes, 2006 ). A complete breakdown of the PEM fuel cell can be seen in Figure 1, illustrating the simplicity of its components in both design and functionality. How do Hydrogen Fuel Cells Function? PEM fuel cells run on hydrogen and oxygen and produce only electricity, water, and excess heat as by-products of their operation. The production of electricity happens through an electrochemical process known in science as an oxidation-reduction ( redox ) reaction, which takes place at the anode and cathode of the fuel cell. In this type of reaction, what actually occurs are two simultaneous half reactions. At the anode of the fuel cell, hydrogen is being oxidized ( losing electrons ), and at the cathode, oxygen is being reduced ( gaining electrons ). Fuel cells function by capitalizing on the movement of the electrons that takes place in this redox reaction. This is accomplished by routing the electron flow through an external circuit that can be [MASK_NOLOSS] The end result of this reaction is an efficient conversion of hydrogen fuel into usable electricity. PEM fuel cells have a theoretical maximum efficiency of 83% ; however, to obtain a usable amount of power, fuel cells operate at lower efficiencies, usually between 30 and 60% ( Barbir, 2005 ).

It is this need for education that provides an excellent opportunity for technology teachers throughout the United States. HFC technology is a subject area that aligns very well with Standards for Technological Literacy, Chapter 7, Standard 16 -- \" Students will develop an understanding of and be able to select and use energy and power technologies \" ( ITEA, 2000/2002/2007 ). In fact, even if not featured in a unit of its own, in order to successfully fulfill Standard 16 today, students would almost certainly need to be exposed to HFC technology. With the rising importance of environmental and energy education, technology teachers may better cement their positions and boost the significance of technology education for all students by adding an alternative energy topic [MASK_NOLOSS] Strategies for Fuel Cell Technology HFC technology can be taught through a variety of instructional strategies, such as design and problem solving, cooperative learning, inquiry-based instruction, web-based instruction, interdisciplinary instruction, and modular instruction ( Helgeson, 2003 ).

       " '[YEAR:2010]With the decreasing availability of oil and the perpetual dependence on foreign-controlled resources, many people around the world are beginning to insist on alternative fuel sources. Hydrogen fuel cell technology is one answer to this demand ( Ewing, 2007 ). Although modern fuel cell technology has existed for over a century, the technology is only now becoming affordable enough to turn the concept into reality for the consumer market ( Concurrent Technologies Corporation, 2009 ). As the demand for fuel cells increases, prices will continue to drop as this technology becomes recognized as a viable energy source. </p> Technology teachers can utilize hydrogen fuel cell technology to address content standards dealing with energy inputs, processes, and outputs as indicated in Standards for Technological Literacy : Content for the Study of Technology ( STL ) ( ITEA/ITEEA, 2000/2002/2007 ) : Standard 5 -- the effects of technology on the environment, Standard 16 -- energy and power technologies, and Standard 18 -- transportation technologies. Through research and activity, students and teachers can understand and apply the technology and become advocates, thus fulfilling the technological [MASK_NOLOSS] in 1800 split water into hydrogen and oxygen by using an electric current ( NYSERDA, n.d. ) - This process was later named electrolysis. Christian Friedrich Schoenbein in 1838 reversed the electrolysis process and developed the fuel-cell effect by combining hydrogen and oxygen and producing electricity and water ( NYSERDA, n.d. ). Sir William Robert Grove, a friend of Schoenbein, created the first fuel cell, dubbed \" the gas battery, \" in 1845 ( CFCL, 2009 ). Grove became known as the \" Father of the Fuel Cell \" because of his invention ( NYSERDA, n.d. ). </p> It is debatable which team of scientists should be credited with creating the first modern fuel cell. In 1989, Ludwig Mond and Carl Langer created a cell using coal gas, air, and electrodes made of perforated platinum. They were able to achieve 6 amps per square foot area of an electrode ( Smithsonian Institution, 2004 ) and also coined the name \" fuel cell \" ( Concurrent Technologies Corporation, 2009b ) [MASK_NOLOSS] and C. Thompson also created a fuel cell using double-coated plates. They complained about gas leaks and said that if money were not an object, then a device could be made to produce quantities of electricity sufficient for industry ( Woodside, 2006 ). </p> Francis Thomas Bacon',\n",

Papin, an associate professor at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, said the model can reduce the time and effort bioengineers spend manipulating algae genes. </p> The researchers based their model on a mathematical formula that quantitatively represents light and that predicts how algae grow under different light sources, such as light-emitting diodes or sunlight. </p> \" With a computer model you can explore tens of thousands of permutations that would take many researchers significant time to identify through experimentation, \" Papin said. \" With our model, you can predict which light sources will produce the desired results and save all the effort and resources.

If a male is successful, the female settles down long enough to allow him to mount her and transfer his sperm. Both in the laboratory and in the wild, males will also attempt to court other males, particularly younger ones that have just become adult. </p> It is now possible to produce strains of Drosophila that lack a particular gene but are otherwise like normal, or as they are called, \" wild-type \" flies. Scientists can also inactivate genes or insert genes where they wouldn\\'t normally occur. Such research shows that a particular gene dubbed fruitless is one of the most important genes regulating sexual behavior [MASK_NOLOSS] mutation in this gene will try to court females, but they do so incorrectly. It\\'s still not clear where their problem lies, but it may be that they fail to fully extend their wings to sing, a deal breaker from the female\\'s perspective. Male flies with other types of mutations of the fruitless gene will court fellow males in addition to, or instead of, females. And female flies with a mutated fruitless gene that expresses a brain-masculinizing protein will court other females, employing the same stereotyped set of movements ordinarily used by males. </p> The fruitless gene affects many different parts of the fly brain, some of which are already known to be important in regulating sexual behavior. A Japanese researcher, Ken-ichi Kimura, and his coworkers meticulously dissected the brains of Drosophila and found a cluster of about thirty neurons in wild-type males that is absent in males that court other males. Fruitless-mutant females that court other females have a robust male-size cluster, whereas normal females lack it. </p> So is [MASK_NOLOSS] or absence of certain nerve cells, all that\\'s needed to make a fly \" gay \"?

In other words, it takes both genes to ensure that males court females -- and females don\\'t. </p> Then, are those two genes all that\\'s involved in making a fly gay or straight? Once again, no. A male also needs to detect that a female is out there in the first place, which means processing the [MASK_NOLOSS], and still more genes seem to be involved along with fruitless in that process. Females that have already mated exude a lust-quashing pheromone that they\\'ve received from the male. Work by researchers Tetsuya Miyamoto and Hubert Amrein at Duke University, published in 2008, showed that a pheromone detection gene ( unimaginatively labeled Gr32a ) was critical to the mating game. Males with a certain mutation in it will court already-mated females as well as other males, and they will even try to actually mate with the males. </p> The neurochemical dopamine, which is found in many animals and is important in a wide variety of physiological activities, also turns out to feature in same-sex courtship in Drosophila. If you increase it, males are more likely to court other males, although they don\\'t change how they react to virgin females or to odor cues in general. In 2008, Kyung-an Han, a neurobiologist now at the University of Texas at El Paso but then at Perm state, conducted an experiment that combined sex [MASK_NOLOSS] flies that were exposed to ethanol ( the type of alcohol in beer, vodka, and other adult beverages ) exhibited same-sex courtship, which became more pronounced with repeated exposure to the alcohol -- but dropped off if their dopamine production was inhibited.

This is an issue that would deserve further attention. </p> The value of describing the **28;76751;TOOLONG average is demonstrated by the FD ellipses at the NW section of the contour. With only separate SPL and F0 variance calculations, this segment would not have been otherwise revealed as an area where the contributing curves line up, considering there is large variance in both SPL and F0 on that side of the contour. However, these variances are strongly correlated, as is manifested by an ellipse with the long axis parallel to the contour curve and the short axis cross-sectional to it. This [MASK_NOLOSS] B, D, F, and H of Figure 3, was reported neither by Heylen nor Suiter. </p> Note that to allow for visual comparison between VRP curves, it is essential to plot the xly graphs using a fixed aspect ratio. The typical choice is 2:1 semitone/ decibel ( conforming to the Union of European Phoniatricians recommendation by Schutte &; Seidner, 1983 ) or 3:2 semitone/decibel ( see, e.g., Coleman, 1993 ). The 2:1 ratio, which is used throughout this article, leads to a slight deformation of the originally rectangular crosshairs in the SD circles ( as can be observed in Figures 1 and 3 ), as the FD model calculations were based on an equal, 1:1 proportion between semitone and decibel scales. This deviation between plot scale and model scale also makes the physical storage-cell size of 1 semitone x 1 decibel not appear as a square box ( see Figure 2 and also Figure 4, which is discussed in more detail in the next section ). </p> Density-Based Averaging Versus FD [MASK_NOLOSS] using very different averaging methods, there is good agreement between the two. Considering the curve at exactly 50% overlap divides the population of VRPs into two, it corresponds to a median, and its location is thus little influenced by aberrant or outlier VRP contours. Here, we use the term median contour to differentiate it from the mean contour, thereby also implicitly referring to the known properties of the median and the mean. </p> Note that Figure 4 indicates that the FD averaging tends to produce more rounded curves.

This study explores how targeting lifelong learners through the medium of educational tourism might be one such way in which universities can impart moral and ethical lessons, through a pedagogical construction based on the Aristotelian notion of practical wisdom ( phronesis ). A qualitative analysis of surveys and interviews conducted with educational tourism providers, lifelong learners, and academic scholars, reveals that whilst intentional learning is central to educational tourism and much of that learning is values-based, the ability of a university to engage with a wide cross-section of people through this medium is not without its problems. </p> lifelong learning, phronesis, educational tourism, ethics, experiential learning </p> Introduction Universities have long imagined themselves not only as sites for the production of knowledge but also moral attitude, variously expressed as'character ','citizenship'or'good behaviour '. Charles William Eliot, Harvard's longest-serving and arguably most notable president [MASK_NOLOSS] supported students'who prove themselves men of capacity and character'( Karabel, 2005, p. 40 ). More recently, Stephen Schwartz, the Vice-Chancellor of Macquarie University in Australia answered his own rhetorical question'should universities have moral goals?'in the affirmative. This could be achieved, Schwartz argued, by instilling in graduates a set of liberal values and ethics via a process of learned behaviour : </p> How can we expect our students to analyse ethical issues such as stem-cell research, nanotechnology, euthanasia or freedom of speech if we do not show them how? ( Schwartz, 2007, p. 2 ). </p> This is a view with some support across the higher education sector. Following Schwartz's statement were reports that Macquarie University was considering rewriting its curriculum to include moral education and requiring students to do unpaid community work ( Romei, 2009 ). And despite evidence of pressure to prioritise the supply of skilled workers for an increasingly globalised market ( Bansel, 2007 ), universities retain what Marginson [MASK_NOLOSS] regimes. These include ideals of justice, solidarity, compassion, cosmopolitan tolerance and empathy for others. </p> One way in which universities have acted to promote ethical outcomes at the student level has been to re-conceptualise generic skills -- the idea of a base set of skills that make a student more employable --\",\n",

The organism can be nonencapsulated ( ncHi ) or classified into 1 of 6 serotypes ( Hia-Hif ) on the basis of capsular polysaccharide characteristics. Hib is the most virulent serotype ; before routine vaccination was implemented, Hib was responsible for &gt;80% of all invasive H. influenzae infections, mainly in children &lt;5 years of age ( 1 ). Routine immunization with Hib conjugate vaccines, however, has greatly reduced the incidence of invasive Hib disease worldwide ( 1 ). As a consequence, invasive infections [MASK_NOLOSS] common. </p> The United Kingdom introduced the Hib conjugate vaccine in 1992 as a 3-dose infant schedule alongside a 12-month catch-up campaign for all children &lt;5 years of age ( 2 ). This campaign resulted in a rapid reduction in invasive Hib disease across all age groups ( 2 ). After 1999, however, Hib disease increased, particularly among toddlers ( 3 ). Potential explanations for this increase include a greater than expected decline in Hib antibodies after primary immunization, waning of herd immunity after the initial catch-up campaign, and use of a less immunogenic Hib combination vaccine with diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis ( DTaP-Hib ) in 2000-2001 ( 3 ). This resurgence led to establishment of several control measures -- re-introduction of a whole-cell pertussis-containing Hib vaccine ( DTwP-Hib ) in 2002, an Hib booster campaign for toddlers in 2003, and a routine 12-month Hib booster in 2006 -- that resulted in rapid control of Hib disease ( 3 ). </p> Because conjugate vaccines also reduce pharyngeal carriage ( 4 ), concerns have [MASK_NOLOSS] ecologic niche and result in invasive disease ( serotype replacement ) ( 5 ), although no\",\n",

Some countries have reported small but significant increases in invasive ncHi disease after routine Hib vaccination ( 7-10 ) ; others have not ( 11, 12 ). Increases in invasive Hif disease have also been reported, albeit with a small number of cases over years ( 8, 13-16 ). </p> In England and Wales, the Health Protection Agency ( HPA ) has conducted enhanced national H. influenzae surveillance ( encompassing a denominator population of? 55 million persons ) for &gt;2 decades. The continuing decline in invasive Hib disease meant that in 2009, for the first time, other encapsulated H. influenzae serotypes overtook Hib as the most prevalent causes of invasive H. influenzae disease ( 17 ). During 2009-2010, therefore, the HPA investigated the clinical, epidemiologic, and microbiologic characteristics of invasive encapsulated H. influenzae disease. </p> Methods The Health [MASK_NOLOSS] confidential patient information for public health purposes ( **50;54288;TOOLONG ).

Clinicians, microbiologists, and public health physicians are encouraged to report invasive H. influenzae cases to the HPA and submit isolates for species confirmation and serotyping ( 19 ).

Certain features that were previously attributed primarily to ncHi, such as causing hepatobiliary disease ( 28, 29 ) and disease during pregnancy ( 30 ), were also observed among Hie and Hif case-patients, respectively, in our study. The proportion of case-patients with comorbidities in our cohort was similar to previous smaller studies ( 60%-80% ) ( 13, 27, 31-34 ) and to that among ncHi case-patients ( 13, 26, 33, 35-37 ). Several Hif case-patients had disorders of B-cell immunity, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma, which have also been reported among persons with invasive ncHi ; this finding suggests a major role for humoral immunity ( 10 ). Declining B-cell function has also been speculated to explain the increasing incidence with age ( 10 ). The finding that none of the infants in this study had any reported comorbidities at infection, however, is intriguing [MASK_NOLOSS] comorbidities, which suggests that some of these infants might have as-yet-undetected subtle immunologic abnormalities that made them vulnerable to opportunistic infections. </p> Although Hie and Hif should be compared with caution because of the relatively small number of cases, our results suggest that Hie causes more severe clinical disease. This observation is supported by recent population-based studies that have reported a worse outcome for patients with Hie than for those with Hif, including a CFR of 24% versus 10.0% ( p = 0.003 ) in a study in Europe ( 7 ) and 32% versus 6% ( p = 0.002 ) in a US study ( 38 ). One possible reason that Hie has a lower incidence but it is more fatal than Hif could be that this serotype is less pathogenic and infects persons who are older and/or in much poorer health and who, therefore, are more likely to die. This hypothesis, however, is not supported by our study because the median age at disease onset and the prevalence of any or multiple comorbidities were similar, and [MASK_NOLOSS] risk factors. However, the 6-month CFR for the 2 serotypes was similar, which suggests that these pathogens can infect highly vulnerable persons who, even if they survived the infection, subsequently succumbed to their underlying illness ; this finding has been also observed for invasive ncHi disease ( 10, 35 ).

Our results show substantial shifts in the B. pertussis population over time and a reduction in genetic diversity. These changes might have resulted from the introduction of pertussis vaccines in Denmark and other parts of Europe. The predominant strains currently circulating in Denmark resemble those in other European countries. </p> Whooping cough is a vaccine-preventable disease caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis ; however, the protection conferred by vaccination does not last throughout life. In Denmark, as in other industrialized countries with high vaccination coverage, the disease is still endemic despite? 50 years of vaccination. In 1961, a whole-cell B. pertussis ( wP ) vaccine was introduced into the childhood vaccination schedule in Denmark. In January 1997, it was replaced by a monocomponent acellular B. pertussis ( aP ) vaccine ( DiTeKiPol or DiTeKiPol/ActHib ; Statens Serum Institut SSI, Copenhagen, Denmark ) containing hydrogen peroxide-inactivated B. pertussis toxoid as the sole pertussis [MASK_NOLOSS] the National Institutes of Health ( Bethesda, MD, USA ) ( 1, 2 ). In 2003, a booster dose for preschool-age children ( 5 years of age ) was introduced ( diTekiBooster or DiTeKiPol Booster ; SSI ). Coverage among infants in Denmark for the third dose of pertussis vaccine has traditionally been high (? 87%-91% ) ( 3 ). Acellular pertussis vaccines can contain up to 5 different antigens from B. pertussis, and Denmark is the only country using a monocomponent vaccine for both primary and booster vaccination ( 4 ). </p> The incidences of whooping cough and related deaths in Denmark have decreased dramatically since the introduction of pertussis vaccines. During a whooping cough epidemic in the early 1950s, before vaccine was introduced, the incidence of infection was? 11,000 per 100,000 infants ( 5 ). In 2010, however, the incidence of infection among infants 0-1 year old had dropped to 110 per 100,000 infants and the incidence among the whole population had dropped to 7 per 100,000 persons ( 6 ) [MASK_NOLOSS] infants in Denmark were',\n",

Although in that study and the study reported here, the same [MASK_NOLOSS] same research technologist interpreted the results, the overall seroprevalence in the study reported here was higher than that among high-risk patients with extensive arthropod or animal contact ( 49.5% ) and differed substantially from serologic results from healthy volunteers ( 15 ). However, in the study reported here, a large portion of the population ( 34.5% ) was also seroreactive to B. vinsonii berkhoffii genotype II. Immunophenotypic properties giving rise to seroreactivity to this particular antigen among healthy control and patient populations have not been clarified but could be related to polyclonal B-cell activation, commonly found in patients with rheumatologic or chronic inflammatory diseases. </p> It is becoming increasingly clear that no single diagnostic strategy will confirm infection with a Bartonella sp. in immunocompetent patients. Before the current study, we primarily used BAPGM enrichment blood cultures and PCR to test symptomatic veterinarians, veterinary technicians, and wildlife biologists, who seem to be at occupational risk for Bartonella sp. bacteremia because of animal contact and frequent arthropod exposure ( 10-15, 23 ).

Such adaptations could have an obvious evolutionary advantage, but if they fail to match actual postnatal conditions, the adult organism could be at increased risk for certain diseases. This, according to Gluckman and colleagues ( 2007 ), is the case for humans in the modern developed world, where the balance between energy intake and expenditure is very different from its ancestral value and therefore from the proposed in utero prediction. This, it is argued, is the cause of the present epidemic of chronic noncommunicable diseases. </p> This idea -- that a mismatch between the modern-day human condition and that of our hunter-gatherer forebears has implications for our propensity to certain diseases -- has been explored by a number of other authors, although they did not emphasize [MASK_NOLOSS] ( Eaton et al. 1988, Nesse and Williams 1994, O\\'Keefe and Cordain 2004, Varki 2009 ). The past two decades have seen a number of powerful arguments favoring the value of an evolutionary perspective for medicine. Lappe ( 1994 ) was primarily concerned with the evolution of antibiotic resistance among bacteria, but he emphasized the more general need for the medical community to take cognizance of evolutionary theory. Nesse and Williams ( 1994 ) clarified a number of misunderstandings about evolutionary medicine and cautioned that attempts to improve the species by eugenics are misguided ; some of our vulnerabilities to disease may be favored by natural selection because apparently deleterious genes can have unidentified advantages ( the well-known case of the sickle-cell trait is far from unique ), and there is no such thing as a \" normal \" human genome. </p> This view received surprising support in 2008, when a genomic phylostratigraphic study of disease-related genes revealed that most such genes in humans date back to, or before, the earliest eukaryote, and many of the [MASK_NOLOSS] Tautz 2008 ).

Some disease-related genes that have arisen by gene duplication and mutation may be of relatively recent origin, but they appear to represent a minority. According to Domazet-Loo and Tautz ( 2008 ), very few disease-related genes postdate the origin of mammals. </p> Autoimmune diseases : General considerations Five potential etiological and pathophysiological processes have been implicated in autoimmune diseases : inflammation, apoptosis, genetic predisposition, infection, and environmental triggers ( Mackay et al. 2008 ). Inflammation is closely linked to autoimmunity ; to date, this relationship has underpinned the standard approach to the treatment of most such conditions, including AIH ( e.g., Theve et al. 2008, Testro and Visvanathan 2009, Meyer 2009 ). Apoptosis in excess may increase the exposure of autoantigens to the immune system, but if it is insufficient, it may fail to eliminate autoreactive lymphocyte clones ( Mackay et al. 2008, Meyer 2009 ). Studies of genetic predisposition have been focused mainly on diversity in the HLA locus ( Bland et al [MASK_NOLOSS] levels of autoantibodies. Although few human infections have been definitively linked to autoimmune diseases so far ( Mackay et al. 2008 ), there is evidence for a causal connection in some cases ( e.g., Epstein-Barr virus EBV causing infectious mononucleosis in young adults appears to be a risk factor for multiple sclerosis ; Thacker et al. 2006 ). Moreover, the environmental triggers for autoimmune disorders identified to date, apart from xenobiotics, are mostly infectious agents, notably viruses ( Bland et al. 2009 ). Autoimmune disorders affecting distinct organs and loss of self-tolerance may be explained by molecular mimicry between foreign and self-antigens ( Fujinami 1988 ). </p> However, the relationship between autoimmunity and infection is complicated.

Autoimmune disorders affecting distinct organs and loss of self-tolerance may be explained by molecular mimicry between foreign and self-antigens ( Fujinami 1988 ). </p> However, the relationship between autoimmunity and infection is complicated. It often seems that the overall burden of infections dating from childhood is instrumental, along with genetic predisposition, in inducing autoimmunity ; conversely, according to the hygiene hypothesis, infections during childhood might protect the patient from autoimmune diseases ( Liu and Murphy 2003 ). </p> Involvement of SLAM and SAP in both infectious and [MASK_NOLOSS] ( SLAM ) and related proteins in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases has been studied in animal models. For example, a murine study showed that the SLAM and Fc-gamma receptor intervals in the lupus-susceptibility locus Nba2 on chromosome 1 act cooperatively on the differentiation and survival of autoantibody-producing cells ( Jrgensen et al. 2010 ). In particular, SLAM-associated protein ( SAP ), encoded by the X-chromosomal gene SH2D1A, has been implicated in X-linked lymphoproliferative disease ( Veillette et al. 2007 ), which makes patients abnormally susceptible to infection with EBV ( Hislop et al. 2010 ). SAP binds to SLAM-family receptors, and the cytoplasmic Srcrelated protein tyrosine kinase FynT is recruited ( Latour et al. 2003 ), initiating a signal sequence that plays a crucial role in regulating T-cell and natural killer ( NK ) -cell function. This signaling pathway appears to have a role in various autoimmune conditions, including systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) and AIH ( Furukawa et al. 2010 ). </p> For the purposes of the present article [MASK_NOLOSS] a specific gene product -- SAP -- has been implicated in both viral infection and autoimmune disease. However, this entails the involvement of the adaptive immune response.

It is well known that most autoimmune disorders involve recognition of autoantibodies by B cells, with ( usually ) no evident T-cell involvement, so the innate immune response would seem to be more important. In this context, the possible role of TLRs must be considered. </p> Toll-like receptors and other pattern-recognition receptors Several pattern-recognition receptors ( PRRs ), a network of germline-encoded receptors, have been identified during the past two decades. PRRs recognize molecular motifs characteristic of infectious microorganisms and also endogenous molecules produced by injured tissues ( Montero Vega and de Andrs Martn 2009 ). They control many aspects of both innate and adaptive immunity ( Joffre et al. 2009 ) and regulate tissue repair and regeneration ( Rakoff-Nahoum and Medzhitov 2008 ). They have been implicated in a wide variety of pathological conditions, suggesting that a universal immunobiological model could explain a multiplicity of human diseases [MASK_NOLOSS] these sensors are the TLRs, 10 of which are known to be expressed in humans ; their structures and functions have been reviewed by Montero Vega and de Andrs Martn ( 2009 ) and Testro and Visvanathan ( 2009 ). The recent identification of mutations and common polymorphisms in the TLRs has revealed their importance not only in susceptibility to infection but also in several noninfectious diseases ( Misch and Hawn 2008 ). In particular, in some autoimmune disorders, recognition of endogenous ligands by TLRs leads to sustained responses by innate immune cells that contribute to a loss of self-tolerance ( Wagner 2006 ). Many autoantigens exposed by tissue injury stimulate innate immunity through TLRs ( Marshak-Rothstein 2006 ). In vivo and in vitro studies have revealed that self-DNA and self-RNA translocated by endosomes stimulate plasmacytoid dendritic cells via TLR9- and TLR7-dependent pathways, just as microbial nucleic acids do ( Montero Vega and de Andrs Martn 2009 ).

Since 1990, it has become evident that AIH is immunoserologically and genetically heterogeneous ; there are racial, geographic, and genetic variations in clinical manifestations, disease progression, and treatment outcome ( Manns and Vogel 2006, Czaja 2008 ). [MASK_NOLOSS] two decades of life and women are more susceptible than men ( Bland et al. 2009 ). </p> Human leukocyte antigen polymorphism It is well established that HLA class I and II polymorphisms are associated with autoimmune diseases, such as autoimmune thyroid disease ( Kim et al. 2003 ). It is now evident that HLA diversity also influences susceptibility to viral diseases, including HBV and HCV infections ( Shichi et al. 2008 ). HLA class I diversity seems to have a role in the innate immune response as well as in the acquired immune response. </p> The susceptibility alleles ( e.g., DRB1*0301 and DRB1*0401 ) for AIH in white North American and northern European patients have been identified on the gene DRB1 ( Czaja 2008 ). They encode a six-residue sequence, associated with susceptibility, at positions 67-72 in the DR? chain of the major MHC class II molecules ; the key determinant is lys-71 ( Czaja and Donaldson 2000 ). Factors influencing the severity of the disease include the DR? 71 gene dose and [MASK_NOLOSS] e.g., TNF-?, cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4, the tumor necrosis factor-receptor superfamily ; Czaja 2008 ). Other susceptibility alleles reflecting indigenous triggering antigens may be significant in different geographic regions, and these may provide clues to the environmental triggers involved in AIH. </p> It is likely that MHC polymorphism is implicated in the persistence of HCV infection ( Huang and Koziel 2000 ). Moreover, HCV appears to suppress T-cell responses ( Huang and Koziel 2000 ). </p> Autoantigens in autoimmune hepatitis Most liver-specific autoantigens are enzymes with key roles in cellular homeostasis. In AIH patients, many of the disease-specific autoantibodies are directed against cytochrome P450 2D6 ( CYP2D6 ; Bogdanos and Dalekos 2008 ). Antibodies against the same or functionally related enzymes have been recognized in patients chronically infected with hepatitis C ( Sutti et al. 2010 ) and drug-induced autoimmunity ( Obermayer-Straub et al. 2000 ). </p',\n",

It is not yet known whether the same applies to human disease, but in view of the foregoing evidence, the idea is at least plausible. </p> Hepatitis and sex hormones Liver-specific expression of the HBV surface antigen gene was investigated in transgenic mice by Farza and colleagues ( 1987 ). Expression rose dramatically in males at puberty but not in females, and this rise was reversed by castration ; nevertheless, not only testosterone but also both estrogen and glucocorticoids stimulated expression of the gene.

The unsaturated:saturated fatty acid ratio was higher in infected animals.

( 5 ) Childhood infections have become much less frequent in developed countries ( hygiene hypothesis ) ; therefore, T helper 2-mediated immune responses are not suppressed. ( 6 ) At puberty, EVLA is activated concomitantly with genes involved in sexual activity and sex-hormone secretion.

       " '[YEAR:2012] diseases, which potentially exhibit an evolutionary linkage [MASK_NOLOSS] proposed in this article can be tested critically in specific applications, such as the possible relationship between AIH and an ancestral viral infection. As a general account of the origin of autoimmune and other chronic diseases, it is not amenable to refutation. The infection-AIH proposal should be testable in mice, some strains of which are especially susceptible to viral hepatitis and to murine AIH ; to date, however, no evidence for the epigenetic inheritance of viral genes in infected mice has been reported, although a large-scale study would be required to detect what must -- if it occurs at all -- be a low-probability event. </p> Moreover, the hypothesis comprises a combination of nonmainstream and, in some cases, controversial ideas from a variety of different fields. It is hard to reconcile it with mainstream hypotheses about autoimmunity ( e.g., clonal deletion, clonal anergy, idiotype network theory ), and that in itself must invite skepticism. Moreover, it does not always provide convincing explanations in areas where the mainstream hypotheses appear weak ; [MASK_NOLOSS] for the absence of T-cell responses that are typical of autoimmune conditions. The established connection between infection and autoimmunity is also commonly explained by reference to superantigens, which is a much simpler explanation than the hypothesis provides, although superantigens have not been identified in all relevant cases. However, the induction of autoimmune conditions by chemical agents, as in the case of drug-induced SLE, which is difficult to explain by mainstream theory, could potentially be elucidated by our hypothesis ; that suggests a worthwhile program of experiments using suitable animal models. </p> Conclusions The hypothesis that we have outlined here implies that a long-lasting external influence can be coded by a biological system into a persistent set of data, which can remain silent until it is functionalized by appropriate conditions and provoked by a relevant secondary influence. If ancestral microbial infections are the origin of an autoimmune disease, the extraction and use of the original or related antigens to induce immune tolerance is, theoretically, a plausible therapeutic approach. </p> Moreover, the hypothesis predicts that the [MASK_NOLOSS] the variability of external influences over time. This provides a context for predicting future illnesses by estimating the burden and penetrability of recent influences. For example, cigarette smoking is a known cause of obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer. If this effect continues for a sufficient time, the hypothesis predicts that future generations may suffer from a primary obstructive lung disease, similar in nature to the smoking-related lung',\n",

Some of the highly chlorinated PCBs were also associated with the echogenicity of the intima-media complex, a marker of vascular wall composition. Total TEQ was positively associated with IMT and inversely associated with the echogenicity of the intima-media complex but not associated with plaque prevalence. These relationships were statistically significant after adjusting for CV risk factors, including lipids, suggesting that POPs may have a vascular effect not mediated by traditional risk factors for atherosclerosis. To the best of our knowledge, no other study has reported associations between POP levels and measures of atherosclerosis in a large human sample. </p> Comparison with the literature. Associations between POP exposure and myocardial infarction based on studies of highly exposed individuals ( through accident or occupational exposure ) [MASK_NOLOSS] Chase et al. 1982 ; Dalton et al. 2001 ; Sergeev and Carpenter 2010 ). However, because POP exposure has also been associated with well-known CV risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and obesity ( Everett et al. 2008 ; Goncharov et al. 2008 ; Lee et al. 2007, 2011a, 2011b ; Ronn et al. 2011 ), it is unclear whether POPs might induce myocardial infarction by altering risk factors or by a more direct action on the vascular wall. </p> Biological rationale. Development of atherosclerosis is a complicated chain of events starting with accumulation of LDL cholesterol in the subintimal space. After oxidation of LDL, immunocompetent cells such as monocytes and T-cell lymphocytes are attracted to the site of lipid oxidation by activation of adhesion molecules from the endothelium, and the chronic repair-of-injury process begins with the liberation of proinflammatory cytokines. </p> POPs may interfere with this process in several ways. For example, POPs have been associated with an increased blood pressure, with proatherogenic alterations [MASK_NOLOSS] and obesity ( Everett et al. 2008 ; Ha et al. 2009 ; Lee et al. 2007, 2011b ; Ronn et al. 2011 ; Uemura et al. 2009 ). However, associations between several of the POPs and markers of atherosclerosis were evident despite adjustment for classical CV risk factors, which suggests that associations, if causal, might reflect direct effects of POPs on atherosclerosis.

       " \"[YEAR:2012]A decades-old technology for producing low-level electric current has experienced a recent resurgence in interest and potential applications # Low-power, mobile electronic devices are becoming increasingly widespread, and they all need to be supplied with electricity. In large part, lithium-ion and similar batteries are well suited to the task. But the Achilles'heel of those conventional chemical batteries is their limited longevity : The batteries must frequently be recharged and replaced, and they can not operate at extreme temperatures. Recent advances have positioned betavoltaic batteries to respond to that weakness. # Betavoltaic power sources store energy in a beta-emitting radioisotope ; that energy is converted to electricity when the beta particles interact with a semiconductor p-n junction to create electron-hole pairs that are drawn off as current. In that way, betavoltaics and photovoltaics can be considered close cousins. Betavoltaic devices can operate continuously for years or even decades--depending on the half-life of the beta source--even under extreme temperatures ( -50 C to 150 C ) at which chemical batteries fail. They offer advantages under conditions that render battery replacement difficult, impossible, or life threatening [MASK_NOLOSS] sources are crucial to device operation. In this article we discuss the history, principles of operation, and applications of betavoltaics. # Historical review # Both betavoltaic and modern photovoltaic technologies owe their inception to Paul Rappaport's 1953 work at RCA.1 He and his colleagues coupled an alloy of the beta-emitting isotopes strontium-90 and yttrium-90 to silicon and other semiconductor junctions to generate power. Their Si-based device converted 0.2% of the incident beta flux into electricity, but the semiconductors degraded quickly, apparently due to radiation damage : It turns out that the beta particles emitted by 90Sr and 90Y were energetic enough to displace atoms in a crystalline solid. From 1953 to 1956, the RCA researchers continued their betavoltaic investigations, using 90Sr, 90Y, and also promethium-147, whose beta particles are less energetic.2 But their focus gradually turned toward the development of Si and gallium arsenide devices for solar-cell applications. # From 1968 to 1974, one of us ( Olsen ) led a group at Donald W.

Much of the battery volume was required for shielding the gamma radiation emitted from the 146Pm contaminant in the 147Pm. That drawback, and the high cost and limited availability of 147Pm, meant that once lithium batteries became available, the Betacel could no longer compete. Pacemakers powered by Betacel batteries were implanted in more than 100 patients before the program was terminated.4 # From 1975 until 2006, studies of betavoltaics [MASK_NOLOSS] substrates, but their efforts yielded limited results in terms of power and efficiency.

       " '[YEAR:2012] of straight-line motions ( runs ) and changes of direction ( tumbles ). In the absence of a stimulus, the runs and tumbles occur randomly, and a population of cells has no preferred direction of travel. The presence of a chemoattractant generates extended movement in the favorable direction, such that the population as whole moves toward the attractant. # The flagellar filaments are attached at their base to the rotary motors described above. The counterclockwise rotation of the flagella causes them to move in a coordinated bundle according to their left-handed helicity, and the result is a run ( Wang et al. 2008 ). Clockwise rotations destabilize the bundle, causing the individual filaments to move independently ; this creates random movements and results in a tumble. A typical run duration for E. coli is about 1 second, whereas a tumble takes just a tenth of this interval ( Phillips et al. 1994, Berg 2000 ). Fluctuations in [MASK_NOLOSS] chemosensory response and thus to affect chemotaxis. Such fluctuations ( or noise ) occur both outside and inside the cells, as is described later, and therefore, it is important to understand their effects on cell motility in order to quantify and model bacterial chemotaxis under realistic conditions. # Sources of noise # Bacterial cells swimming though an environment containing a chemoattractant experience noise both from within themselves and from the environment. Much of the attention on the effects of noise has been concentrated on intracellular processes, presumably because they are present even in a noise- free environment and because they often have a more significant effect on cell motility than would noise from outside. # Inside the cells, noise arises mainly because molecules such as DNA, messenger RNA, and synthesized proteins are usually present at low ( numerical or gravimetric ) concentrations. Therefore, intracellular processes inevitably involve probabilistic collisions between these molecules, and these events are statistically interdependent ( Paulsson 2005 ). This would suggest an inverse relation between system size and the magnitude of [MASK_NOLOSS], for a molecular abundance of N, the scale of the noise varies as? N ( Berg and Purcell 1977 ). Because the Che proteins of E. coli are expressed by specific genes, noise in gene expression has a significant influence on the chemotactic motility of the cells. # Noise associated with gene expression is often classified as intrinsic or extrinsic.

Gene-intrinsic noise refers to molecular-level noise in the reaction steps associated with gene expression. Network- intrinsic noise is generated by fluctuations in signal transduction. Cell-intrinsic noise arises from both of these sources and from fluctuations in cell-specific factors, such as metabolite concentrations, cell size, and cell age ( Kaern et al. 2005 ). # Contrasted with intrinsic noise sources, extrinsic noise is associated with fluctuations and population variability. This should suggest that intrinsic noise creates differences between two reporters within a given cell, whereas extrinsic noise creates differences between two or [MASK_NOLOSS] ( Raser and O'Shea 2005 ). Elowitz and colleagues ( 2002 ) developed an elegant two-reporter assay to distinguish between the two types of noise, and Swain and colleagues ( 2002 ) proposed quantitative expressions for their contributions to the overall genetic noise. # TABLE # Kaern and colleagues ( 2005 ) and Paulsson ( 2005 ) emphasized that the distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic noise may be context dependent. This perspective is also evident from two recent analyses of bacterial chemotaxis. Shibata and Fujimoto ( 2005 ) and Shibata and Ueda ( 2008 ) both explained that intrinsic noise is associated with ( intracellular ) reactions per se, whereas extrinsic noise represents how the noise of the inputs is propagated into noise in the outputs. The latter definition of extrinsic noise conforms with the concepts introduced by other theoretical ( Raser and O'Shea 2005 ) and experimental ( Elowitz et al. 2002 ) investigations, because propagation of internally driven fluctuations from one cell to another are a prime cause of differences between cells in a population. # Not all [MASK_NOLOSS] receptors embedded in the cytoplasm serve as antennae that detect and bind to appropriate chemoattractant molecules ( Baker et al. 2006 ).

The binding process is also stochastic in nature, and bacterial cells have evolved methods to filter the associated noise. Modeling of this filter is described later. The aim of filtering is to detect the true signal ( i.e., ligand concentration ) from a noise-distorted signal. Efficient identification of the true signal requires optimal filtering, as is explained below. The length of time over which the signal is averaged in order to enable a cell to decide whether to tumble or run is inversely proportional to the filter cutoff frequency and determines the adaptation time ( Andrews et al. 2006 ). If this time is too short, the noise is not filtered out sufficiently ; if the time is too long, the bacteria can not detect real changes in the chemoattractant gradient ( Berg and Purcell 1977, Strong et al. 1998 ). An optimal filter provides the best balance between these two limits [MASK_NOLOSS] Patnaik 2007, Hornung and Barkai 2008 ) have indicated that a noise filter at its optimum settings allows noise of just that bandwidth that resonates with the relevant biochemical processes, thereby promoting the final outcome. # In many real situations, the chemoattractant in the extracellular environment is not static ; it is also subject to fluctuations ( Patnaik 2006a, 2007, Xu and Tao 2006 ). This is true not just of chemotaxis but of other microbial processes, as well. There is a remarkable similarity between control strategies for environmental noise and those employed by the cells for gene-intrinsic noise. For example, in continuous cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, optimal filtering of feed stream noise with partial recycling of the filtered outputs helps to restore stable performance from chaotic behavior ( Patnaik 2006b ). Similarly, the galactose-use network in S. cerevisiae has two positive and one negative feedback loops. The positive feedback loops contribute to the establishment of two stable expression states, whereas the negative feedback controls the switching of the cells between these states so [MASK_NOLOSS] changing environment ( Kaern et al. 2005, Hornung and Barkai 2008 ).

Since the maintenance of proper chemotaxis in real ( noise- affected ) environments is of practical importance ( Singh and Olson 2008, Agyingi et al. 2010, Ahmed et al. 2010 ), many researchers have tried to describe, analyze, and regulate the effects of noise. # Most researchers have addressed noise inside bacterial cells and noise present in the binding of ligand molecules to their chemoreceptors. In fewer studies has environmental noise been considered ; however, its significance is now being recognized, because fluctuations in ambient chemoattractant concentrations inevitably affect binding kinetics ( Sourjik and Berg 2002, Patnaik [MASK_NOLOSS] be present at the translational level, at the transcription level, or at both levels. However, Ozbudak and colleagues\\'( 2002 ) experiments showed that gene expression is influenced largely by translational noise. They incorporated the green fluorescence protein ( GFP ) under the control of an inducible promoter into the chromosome of B. subtilis and determined by flow cytometry the variation in expression of GFP from cell to cell. Their results revealed not only that translational noise was dominant but also that the spread in expression levels of GFP followed a greater-than-Poisson variation, which implies that the ratio of the variance to the mean was greater than one. This inference has been corroborated by later studies ( Korobkova et al. 2004, Shibata and Fujimoto 2005, Shibata and Ueda 2008 ). # Whereas intracellular noise is present even without a chemical stimulus, the presence of a chemoattractant introduces an additional source of noise through the binding of the chemical ligand to the chemoreceptors. This noise, too, has its origin in the small number of [MASK_NOLOSS] more than 30 years ago by Berg and Purcell ( 1977 ), who postulated that a sensor of characteristic length a could count an average of N ca 3 molecules when the mean concentration is c. Each such measurement has a noise component? N =? N. This noise inevitably affects the accuracy of measurement ; for chemotaxis, this limits the sensitivity of detection of the \" true \" ligand concentration from a noisy signal by the receptor molecules. # Because genetic noise and receptor-ligand binding noise are germane to the cellular machinery, chemotactic bacteria have evolved methods to control these sources of noise. A common method of noise reduction in gene networks is the use of negative feedback. Whereas this idea is well established',\n",

To investigate whether B. pertussis-induced immunity is protective against infection with B. holmesii, we conducted an analysis using 11 human respiratory B. holmesii isolates collected during 2005-2009 from a highly B. pertussis-vaccinated population in Massachusetts. Neither whole-cell ( wP ) nor acellular ( aP ) B. pertussis vaccination conferred protection against these B. holmesii isolates in mice. Although T-cell responses induced by wP or aP cross-reacted with B. holmesii, vaccine-induced antibodies failed to efficiently bind B. holmesii. B. holmesii-specific antibodies provided in addition to wP were sufficient to rapidly reduce B. holmesii numbers in mouse lungs.

However, splenocytes from wP-vaccinated mice produced high levels of IFN-? and IL-10 on stimulation with heat-killed B. pertussis, B. parapertussis, or B. holmesii, which indicates that wP induces a strong cross-reactive T-cell response to B. holmesii.

A similar trend was observed when live bacteria were used to coat the ELISA plates ( data not shown ), which rules out the possibility that heat inactivation selectively destroys cross-reactive antigens. # To compare the antigens recognized by serum samples from different groups, Western blot analyses were performed on B. pertussis, B. parapertussis, or B. holmesii lysates probed with naive serum or wH-, wP-, or aP-induced serum. wH-induced serum antibodies recognized B. holmesii antigens of various molecular masses but lacked cross-recognition of some higher molecular [MASK_NOLOSS], panel B ).

If the lack of antibody cross-recognition is the only reason wP and aP vaccines are ineffective against B. holmesii infection, then adding B. holmesii-specific antibodies to wP should render the vaccination effective against B. holmesii. # To test this hypothesis, C57BL/6 mice were wP vaccinated or left untreated and later received either naive serum or wP- or wH-vaccinated mouse serum before B. holmesii [MASK_NOLOSS] postinoculation. Neither naive serum nor wP-induced serum reduced B. holmesii numbers, but vaccinated mice that received B. holmesii-immune serum had substantially lowered B. holmesii numbers in the lungs ( Figure 6 ). The finding indicates that the addition of B. holmesii-specific antibodies to wP increases its efficacy against B. holmesii. # Discussion # The epidemiologic data collected by the MDPH suggest that B. holmesii is endemic in Massachusetts and is associated with classic whooping cough-like symptoms ( Figure 1 ). Since the establishment of B. holmesii as a species in 1995 ( 10 ), infections have been sporadically reported worldwide ( 6-9, 12, 13, 15, 17, 18, 20, 21, 23 ). Increasing awareness of pertussis and improved analytical tools in industrialized countries may have contributed to the increased numbers of reported B. holmesii cases. However, nasopharyngeal B. holmesii specimens submitted to the MDPH each year during 2005-2009 likely represent a small fraction of B. holmesii infections in Massachusetts. Serologic testing and PCR are the dominant diagnostic Bordetella identification assays because of their high [MASK_NOLOSS] PCR specific for B. holmesii is widely accepted or used by the MDPH. Less than 25% of B. pertussis cases reported in Massachusetts during 1990-2008 were',\n",
       " '[YEAR:2012] murine infections mimic the course of infection and the immune responses in humans ( 30, 39, 40 ), although an animal model of B. holmesii infection has not been previously described. Unlike the classic Bordetella species, B. holmesii colonizes the murine respiratory tract only when relatively large intranasal inoculums are delivered. This model may be improved, for example, by administering antimicrobial drugs or creating transgenic mice. In this study, reproducible colonization of the respiratory tract was achieved, and statistically significant differences were observed after wH vaccination, which suggests that the mechanisms guiding protective immunity in this model can be used to investigate rapid immune-mediated interactions within the respiratory tract. # We determined that B. pertussis vaccines confer little, if any, protection against B. holmesii, even though 16S rRNA comparative analysis of B. holmesii and B. pertussis suggested that B. holmesii is closely related to B. pertussis. Furthermore [MASK_NOLOSS] fimbriae 2 and 3, adenylate cyclase toxin, and filamentous hemagglutinin recognized few, if any, proteins from multiple B. holmesii isolates ( 14 ), which suggests that these proteins are absent from B. holmesii or are antigenically distinct from B. pertussis. Although vaccine-induced T-cell responses are cross-reactive to B. holmesii ( Figure 4 ), B. pertussis vaccine-induced antibodies poorly bind B. holmesii ( Figure 5 ). Furthermore, B. holmesii-specific, but not B. pertussis-specific, antibody administration efficiently decreased B. holmesii numbers in the lungs of vaccinated mice ( Figure 6 ), which suggests that the lack of cross-reactive antibody responses may result in poor cross-protection of B. pertussis vaccines against B. holmesii. # Our data indicate that B. holmesii is circulating in Massachusetts and that B. pertussis vaccination confers little protection against B. holmesii.

In fact, Dictyostelium cells can decide their motility direction within a few seconds of being exposed to a chemo-attractant gradient, so the single-snapshot assumption seems justified. # Recently it has become possible to compare the above detection theory with results of experiments that exploit microfluidic technology. The microfluidic devices can easily be designed and manufactured to allow for precise control of the chemical concentrations presented to cells. With that technology, a researcher can obtain reproducible distributions of cell behavior as a function of applied conditions ; figure 3 shows an example. Careful quantitative measurements via such devices have confirmed the intuitive notion that at small SNR, cell behavior is limited by the cell\\'s ability to accurately detect gradient directionality.4 # TABLE # Of course, not all sources of noise are directly due to the stochastic binding-unbinding process. For example, the cell is moving and [MASK_NOLOSS] can diffuse in the membrane, at least over short distances. However, given the typical one-second time scale for detection, effects due to motion are rather small. Suppose, for example, that a cell moves at a speed of 0.1 m/s through a solution with c = Kd = 50 nanomoles/litre = 50 nM and a concentration gradient of 1 nM/m. Then the change in occupation probability after one second is roughly 10-3. In contrast, the standard deviation of the binomial binding-unbinding process is? p ( 1 - p )? 0.5. # In addition, the chemoattractant ligand concentration itself fluctuates, as studied in the seminal work of Howard Berg and Edward Purcell on chemosensing in bacteria5 and as extended by others.6 Those fluctuations eventually increase the amount of time it takes to equilibrate the receptor array to a changed chemical field.7 # Signal processing # After detection comes processing.

One application is to stem cells, which retain maximal flexibility in their functional capabilities and can become more specialized in response to external signals. # The chemotaxis network is more complex than the stem cell\\'s circuit, which responds only to average chemical concentrations. A gradient response arises via a comparison of receptor binding values from different parts of the cell, a process that requires communication of information between different cell parts to ensure that only the cell part experiencing the highest local concentration will be identified as the front. That communication could be chemical, mechanical, or both. # A simple assumption proposed by Carole Parent and Peter Devreotes is that the communication takes the form of a diffusing messenger that inhibits signals leading to the actin polymerization responsible for protrusions.8 That assumption has been incorporated into numerous modeling studies, and although the details differ from model to model, the [MASK_NOLOSS] by a competition between that global signal and a locally produced, membrane-bound activator. # The 2D LEGI ( local excitation, global inhibition ) equations introduced by Andre Levchenko and Pablo Iglesias offer a specific realization of how that competition might work.9 In their model, an input variable S(s), which depends on position s along the membrane and reflects the likelihood that a receptor at s is bound, directs the production of a membrane-resident activator with concentration A and an intracellular inhibitor with concentration I.

Higher prevalence of mastitis was reported 47 and 53.5% in dairy goats by Poutrel et al. ( 1997 ) and Ali et al.

However, prevalence and relative importance of different etiological agents of mastitis may differ in different geographical regions ( Contreras et al., 1995 ).

Long-term follow-up of these children revealed that the standardized mortality ratio for bronchiectasis was 46.2 95% confidence interval ( CI ) : 21.1, 87.7 ; p &lt; 0.001 in those born during the peak exposure event and exposed to arsenic in utero and early childhood ( Smith et al. 2006 ). Bronchiectasis is a progressive respiratory disease characterized by repeated lower respiratory tract infections and an intense inflammatory response leading to tissue damage, alterations to lung structure, and premature death in adulthood ( Barker 2002 ). Understanding whether arsenic exposure is able to increase the susceptibility to or exacerbate responses to respiratory infections in early life may help to explain the link between arsenic exposure and the development of bronchiectasis. # There is evidence that prenatal arsenic exposure can increase the susceptibility to respiratory infections in early life.

We have previously shown that in utero exposure of mice to arsenic impairs lung growth and development, induces mucous cell metaplasia in the airways, and alters the expression of genes that regulate lung morphogenesis and mucociliary clearance in the lung, all of which could contribute to the increased risk of respiratory infections in early life ( Ramsey et al. 2013a ). A combination of arsenic-induced impairments to lung growth and immune development are likely mechanisms for the increased rate of respiratory infections in early childhood. # We know little, however, about how arsenic may alter the physiological response to respiratory infections. Both environmental exposure to cigarette smoke and particulate matter not only increase the susceptibility to respiratory infections but also exaggerate the inflammatory responses to respiratory infections ( Arcavi and Benowitz 2004 ; Ciencewicki and Jaspers 2007 ).

Exposure to arsenic in early life may increase the susceptibility to and exacerbate the response to respiratory infections during a period of high susceptibility in infancy. A compromised response to influenza infection in early life may have a significant effect on infant morbidity and mortality, and play an important role in the development of bronchiectasis and other chronic respiratory diseases in arsenic-exposed areas. # In the present study we investigated how exposure to arsenic in utero and throughout postnatal life may alter the response to an infection with influenza during infancy.

In response to MCh, arsenic-exposed mice were not distinguishable from controls in terms of maximum airway resistance ( p = 0.28 ) or parenchymal mechanics ( p &gt; 0.59 ) ( Supplemental Material, Figure S1 ). # Discussion # In this study we investigated the role that arsenic plays in the acute and long-term responses to early life influenza infection. In mice exposed both in utero and postnatally to arsenic in drinking water prior to influenza infection, the numbers of total cells and macrophages in BALF were increased at day 3 PI. At day 7 PI, arsenic exposure increased viral titer, and there was [MASK_NOLOSS] on the number of total cells and neutrophils in BALF. Although arsenic exposure altered the inflammatory cell response to influenza in BALF, arsenic exposure had no effect on the level of cytokines measured in BALF at the time points we measured. Exposure to arsenic and infection with influenza independently impaired lung mechanics in infant mice, and those mice exposed to both arsenic and influenza had the greatest deficits in lung mechanics ( tissue damping ). At 8 weeks of age ( 7 weeks PI ), arsenic-exposed mice had increased airway resistance, increased airway responsiveness to MCh, and increased airway smooth muscle mass compared with control mice. We observed increased tissue damping and tissue elastance at baseline ( lung mechanics measurements taken without MCh ) with the maximum dose of MCh, as well as an increased number of mucus-producing cells in the airways, of influenza-exposed mice compared with control mice. Combined exposure to arsenic and influenza resulted in additive increases in airway responsiveness in 8-week-old females. These data demonstrate how exposure to arsenic in early life can alter [MASK_NOLOSS] and long-term effects on respiratory health. # Early life exposure to arsenic increased viral titer during acute influenza infection ( at day 7 PI ), suggesting that arsenic may alter the innate immune response to influenza. Impaired clearance of viral and bacterial infections has been reported in zebrafish exposed to arsenic through water ( Nayak et al. 2007 ) and in adult mice exposed to arsenic via drinking water ( Kozul et al. 2009 ). Arsenic has been shown to be an immunosuppressant in humans. For example, exposure to arsenic can alter the expression of genes and cytokines involved in immune function, T-cell receptor signaling, and inflammation in human lymphocytes ( Andrew et al. 2008 ; Wu et al. 2003 ) and also alter T-cell proliferation and function ( Gonsebatt et al.',\n",

Urinary arsenic levels in children exposed to arsenic in drinking water were associated with reduced lymphocyte proliferation and IL-2 secretion ( Soto-Pena et al. 2006 ). Arsenic exposure during pregnancy can increase oxidative stress [MASK_NOLOSS], and alter the expression of cord blood cytokines ( IL-1?, IL-8, IFN-?, TNF-? ) ( Ahmed et al. 2011 ). Infants exposed to arsenic in utero have been reported to have impaired thymic development and higher levels of fever, diarrhea, and acute respiratory infections in early life ( Rahman et al. 2011 ; Raqib et al. 2009 ). In experimental studies, mice exposed to arsenic had suppressed antibody formation, inhibited T-cell proliferation and macrophage activity, and altered cytokine expression ( Burns et al. 1991 ; Corsini et al. 1999 ; Lantz et al. 1994 ; Sikorski et al. 1989 ; Soto-Pena and Vega 2008 ; Vega et al. 2001 ).

       " \"[YEAR:2013]In West Africa, Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains co-circulate with M. africanum, and both pathogens cause pulmonary tuberculosis in humans. Given recent findings that M. tuberculosis T-cell epitopes are hyperconserved, we hypothesized that more immunogenic strains have increased capacity to spread within the human host population. We investigated the relationship between the composition of the mycobacterial population in The Gambia, as measured by spoligotype analysis, and the immunogenicity of these strains as measured by purified protein derivative-induced interferon-? release in ELISPOT assays of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We found a positive correlation between strains with superior spreading capacity and their relative immunogenicity. Although our observation is true for M. tuberculosis and M. africanum strains, the association was especially pronounced in 1 M. africanum sublineage, characterized by spoligotype shared international type 181, which is responsible for 20% of all tuberculosis cases in the region and therefore poses a major public health threat in The Gambia. # RESEARCH # Tuberculosis ( TB ), caused by bacterial pathogens of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex ( MTBC ), is a major global health problem. Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest [MASK_NOLOSS] rate ; although TB incidence is decreasing globally, incidence rates are increasing in most countries in the West Africa region ( 1 ). Moreover, almost half of all TB cases in West Africa are caused by infection with an unusual member of the MTBC, M. africanum, a lineage found exclusively in this region. Although M. africanum was initially described in Senegal in 1968 ( 2 ), and despite its importance and high prevalence in this region, relatively little is known about the bacterium ( 3 ). In general, M. africanum can be divided into 2 lineages : Afri1, by SpolDB4 definition ( 4 ), corresponding to the green lineage 6 ( 5 ), which has the highest prevalence in Senegal, Mali, The Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, and Sierra Leone ( 3 ) ; and Afri2 ( 4 ), corresponding to the brown lineage 5 ( 5 ), which is mainly found in the eastern part of West Africa, in countries such as Cte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Benin, Nigeria, and [MASK_NOLOSS] africanum from host to host is a crucial element of the spread of the disease, the underlying biological mechanisms triggering transmission are elusive.

We assessed transmission dynamics and interaction between the 2 mycobacterial populations in The Gambia, a country in western West Africa, and compared the local situation with previously published data from Guinea-Bissau, another country within the region ( 6 ). In particular, considering a recent publication suggesting that conserved mycobacterial T-cell epitopes may play a role in the transmission of the mycobacteria within the host population ( 7 ), we investigated whether differences in immunogenicity between M. tuberculosis and M. africanum strains ( especially of the predominant Euro-American EA and Afri1 lineages ) could predict the success of certain sublineages to transmit and establish themselves within the human host population. # Materials and Methods # Study Population and Sample Collection # Data for our study came from an ongoing TB case-contact study at the Medical Research Council in The Gambia ; TB case-patients were recruited for that study during June 20, 2002-December 21, 2009. Consecutive patients [MASK_NOLOSS] years old, resided in the study area ( Greater Banjul area ), and produced 2 sputum samples that were positive for acid-fast bacilli by Ziehl-Neelsen staining. # Spoligotyping and Analysis # Genomic DNA was purified from the collected sputum samples by using the cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide and chloroform method, as described ( 8 ). Spoligotyping was performed by using commercially available membranes ( Ocimum Biolsolutions, Hyderabad, India ), according to standardized protocols ( 9 ). Spoligotype patterns with ambiguous signature were confirmed by using long-sequence polymorphism PCR. # In addition to analyzing the samples collected in The Gambia, we reanalyzed spoligotypes from published studies from Guinea-Bissau ( 6 ).

Because of this limitation, we sought to confirm our finding with a second approach and conducted a purely temporal analysis. We found that SIT 181 could have been emerging during a certain time in the study period, identifying a temporal cluster during 2007-2008 for which risk for infection with SIT 181 was 2.65-fold higher than that for the whole study period ( 2002-2009 ). # With SIT 181 constituting such a prominent cluster, it is conceivable that the strain's high prevalence is related to selective pressure through, for instance, antimicrobial drug therapy. However, because resistance rates are relatively low in The [MASK_NOLOSS] to apply. Therefore, we suggest another selective mechanism : we believe differences in spreading capacity and the interaction between M. tuberculosis and M. africanum populations might play a crucial role. In contrast to M. africanum, several clustered strains within the M. tuberculosis population have comparable potential to spread within the human host population, but no strain has a notable advantage over another, which results in a well-balanced population structure. We hypothesize that SIT 181, in its expanded ability to spread, resembles these M. tuberculosis strains more than it does strains with other spoligotype patterns in the M. africanum lineage. Thus, SIT 181 has a selective advantage and is able to compete with M. tuberculosis for the same biological niche within the human host. # The nature and extent of epitope variation in M. tuberculosis strains is unclear. Findings range from highly variable T-cell epitopes within the esx gene family ( 19 ) to highly conserved epitopes when comparing genetic variation between predicted epitopes and the remainder of the M. tuberculosis genome ( 7 ). The latter [MASK_NOLOSS] suggests that hyperconservation of T-cell epitopes is beneficial for the bacteria and could result in the successful spread of strains. In our study, we sought to understand whether the magnitude of an induced immune response was correlated with the spreading capacity of the bacteria, with a special focus on SIT 181. We therefore investigated PPD ELISPOT responses of patients infected with either lineage and found a nonsignificant tendency for clustered M. tuberculosis sensu stricto and EA strains toward being more likely than singletons to produce a positive PPD result. This small difference in immunogenicity might be in line with our hypothesis that the M. tuberculosis population spreads fairly homogenously. Consistent with the large observed differences in spreading capability, SIT 181 or clustered M. africanum strains have\",\n",

This could involve screening for the genes involved in amplification and modifying the erythroid progenitors in accordance with the results, with overexpression or constitutive or conditional expression of a gene favoring amplification and suppression of inhibitory genes. Notably, micro RNAs are a class of recently identified small regulatory RNAs that downregulate the expression of their target genes by degrading the target messenger RNA, blocking translation, or both ( Bartel 2009, Guo et al. 2010 ). Hematopoiesis is a multistep process that leads to the production of mature blood cells and is controlled by many factors, including microRNAs. Interestingly, specific microRNAs are important regulators of several aspects of erythropoiesis, including erythroid lineage determination, erythroid progenitor proliferation, terminal erythroid differentiation [MASK_NOLOSS] et al. 2011 ). It is therefore reasonable to speculate that the genetic manipulation of cultured erythroid cells by different combinations of microRNAs might allow the generation of higher numbers of mature RBCs ex vivo. Consistent with this, an immortalized erythroid progenitor cell line derived from human iPSCs was first transformed with the transcription factor stem cell leukemia/T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia 1 ( which plays essential roles in early hematopoiesis and differentiation of erythroid cells and megakaryocytes ) in order to boost the rate of production of hematopoietic cells, especially RBCs ( Kurita et al. 2013 ). Unlike the manipulation of the other cells of the body, genetic manipulation of cultured erythroid cells is unlikely to represent a barrier to the clinical use of the final enucleated RBC product. In addition to microRNAs, another class of noncoding RNA -- long non-coding RNAs ( IncRNAs ) -- has recently been shown to be crucial in important biological processes, including stem cell pluripotency, morphogenesis, and development ( Li X et al. 2013 ). Hu and colleagues ( [MASK_NOLOSS] erythroid prosurvival ( lincRNA-EPS ), a murine IncRNA that is strongly induced when erythroid precursors begin to synthesize hemoglobin and other lineage-specific proteins and that facilitate erythropoiesis by suppressing apoptosis. Careful follow-up studies have demonstrated that lincRNA-EPS mediates this effect at least partly by suppressing the expression of the apoptosis-associated speck-like protein PYCARD, a signaling molecule that promotes cell death through activating caspases ( Ohtsuka et al. 2004 ). Of note, genetic manipulation of lincRNA-EPS expression did not',\n",

Although more research is required, current progress in 3D scaffolds [MASK_NOLOSS] of RBCs by replicating the in vivo environment of the bone marrow niche. # In the future, cell biologists will need to work with bio-material scientists to assess the ability of 3D matrix scaffolds to mimic the hematopoietic niche and support not only HSC or HPC expansion and proliferation but also the retention of HSCs capable of long-term differentiation to generate progeny. We envisage the possibility that, in the near future, 3D scaffolds may be used to produce HSCs or other rare pluripotent or multipotent cell types ex vivo, thus providing for the first time an unlimited source of rare adult stem cells for regenerative medicine practices. Meanwhile, 3D scaffolds also provide a supportive platform and mimic the bone marrow microenvironment, which enables the expansion and maintenance of an HSC supply and RBC production. In addition, even if experiments with 3D scaffolds are becoming more common, not only are structural components such as osteoblasts and mesenchymal stem cells required to mimic the hematopoietic niche, but cellular components including megakaryocytes and macrophages are also needed and in their [MASK_NOLOSS] order to replicate the complex HSC niche in vitro. # Stem-cell-derived RBCs : Potential for other clinical applications # Although the underlying biology of RBC expansion and differentiation has yet to be fully addressed, achievements over the past decades are promising. RBCs, however, have additional clinical applications that do not pose a challenge in terms of the numbers of cells required. There are therefore some realistic intermediate therapeutic goals that could be achieved with the current technology. The clinical applications that are within reach include drug delivery, drug discovery, and reagent RBCs for antibody identification ( figure 1c ). # RBCs are currently being considered as a vehicle for targeted drug delivery. Resealed RBCs, as a drug delivery system, have an excellent capacity to enhance the therapeutic index and to improve patient compliance, with great potential for achieving site-specific drug delivery with minimal drug waste and prolonged drug release.

[MASK_NOLOSS] protein delivery was obtained in mouse models of hemophilia, an X-linked recessive congenital disorder of coagulation caused by coagulation factor VIII or IX deficiency. Hemophilia is currently treated with prophylactic factor infusion, which is expensive and requires high patient compliance ( Chang AH et al. 2006 ). It is possible that ex vivo-generated RBCs from molecularly engineered autologous CD34+ cells might represent a feasible option for achieving therapeutic levels of factor IX in hemophilia patients. Substantial progress in these intermediate clinical applications is likely to ensure that the ex vivo generation of RBC transfusion products will become a reality at some point in the future. # Advances in current technologies mean that in vitro-expanded RBCs could also be applied in drug discovery. In vitro tests using RBCs from donors with rare blood types are used to predict the suitability of these donors for alloimmunized patients. Because RBCs from rare donors are available in limited numbers, the generation of RBCs in vitro from mononuclear cells that are usually discarded during the leukoreduction process or from iPSCs derived from these cells may [MASK_NOLOSS] assays.

Although these issues remain unsolved by the majority of protocols, it is exciting to note that we are already at the stage at which a proof-of-principle RBC product suitable for transfusion has been produced in a laboratory culture from adult peripheral blood stem cells. It seems likely that the first in vitro-produced transfusion RBC product used therapeutically will be targeted at particular transfusion problems involving patients whose needs can not be met by traditional transfusion products or patients with diseases for which ex vivo-expanded cells offer an improvement over traditional products. Aside from the needs of transfusion medicine, ex vivo-generated RBCs may have broader uses as drug delivery vehicles and in other specific circumstances. Although the expansion of abundant, enucleated, adult-like RBCs from human PSCs still presents a number of barriers, it is hoped that continued collaboration among clinical scientists, clinicians, and experts in transfusion medicine will allow the next decade to see significant advances in [MASK_NOLOSS] and transfusion products. # Acknowledgments # We are grateful to anonymous reviewers for their helpful and valuable comments on the manuscript.

Subsequent shear forces between the two rough surfaces could create a seroma. This finding has also been observed with polyurethane implants. There can be a small seroma with a Siltex ( Mentor, USA ) textured implant, but it is not seen with smooth-walled implants. Late infection : This is very rare and cases are largely anecdotal ( 4 ). Early infections are usually caused by endogenous bacteria from the skin or from the milk ducts. In contrast, the pathogenesis of a late infection is believed to involve a bacteremia with seeding of the implant or capsule from a distant site ( 13, 14 ). A bacteremia has been postulated to occur in association with dental procedures, upper respiratory tract infections [MASK_NOLOSS] bacteremia ranges from 5% for colonoscopy to 88% for periodontal surgery. This bacteremia could result in a periprosthetic infection. Malignancy : Breast cancer is a common disease. One in eight women will ultimately be diagnosed with primary breast cancer. Fewer than 0.5% of these cancers are non-Hodgkins lymphoma. Recently, 42 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the breast have been reported in association with breast implants ( 15 ). Most of these have been T cell in origin ; 35 were anaplastic large-cell lymphoma. More recently, a subtype of anaplastic large-cell lymphoma has been described in which malignant cells are confined to a seroma within the capsular pocket. Autoinflation : This is a rare phenomenon that occurs with saline-filled implants and double-lumen implants with saline in the outer lumen. Most studies are anecdotal. In 1997, Robinson and Benos ( 16 ) described five patients who developed unilateral inflation four to nine years after receiving saline implants. In 2006, Peters ( 17 ) described three patients who developed a 50% to 88% unilateral autoinflation four, [MASK_NOLOSS] two most likely mechanisms for autoinflation are an initial hypertonic filling solution or alterations in the valve mechanism, which could allow certain molecules to enter the implant. This could create an osmotic gradient allowing water to enter by diffusion. The finding of elevated levels of uric acid and glucose in some patients would be consistent with this mechanism.

And does the low avidity of IgG against H7 hemagglutinin correlate with subtype H7N9 pathogenesis? # With regard to the first question, it has been reported that for other influenza A viruses, the presence of NAbs correlates with recovery time and the outcomes of the disease ( 24 ). We speculate that the relatively weak NAb response against subtype H7N9 might directly contribute to the severity of the symptoms. In this regard, we note that 1 patient, for whom no Nabs were detectable in convalescent-phase serum at days 17 and 27, died and that another patient, for whom NAb titer was low ( 1:20 ) on day 31, also died, although titers of IgG against H7, H1, and H3 in both patients were very high. # There are several possible explanations for the relatively low NAb response. Immunogenicity of subtype H7N9 virus is probably weaker than that of influenza subtype H5N1 and [MASK_NOLOSS] epitope contents are low in subtype H7N9 proteins, probably leading to a lower immune response against subtype H7N9 virus ( 27 ). Furthermore, it has been reported that the humoral response to subtype H7N7 vaccine is lower than that to subtypes H5N1 and H9N2 after vaccination with a dose that should have stimulated effective immune response ( 28 ). Another reason for the lower NAb response could be inefficient T-cell helper response. The isotype switch of antibody production, such as that from IgM to IgG, as well as the process of antibody affinity maturation, requires T-cell help ( 29 ). This point should be investigated in future studies, such as analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which were not available in our study.

In addition, age can also play a role in attenuated immunity ; the severity of infection with subtype H7N9 virus increases with age ( 2 [MASK_NOLOSS] response against subtype H7N9 infection is caused by several of the aforementioned factors. # With regard to the second question, whether the low avidity of IgG against H7 hemagglutinin correlates with subtype H7N9 pathogenesis, previous studies demonstrated that low-affinity antibodies against A(H1N1)pdm09 virus could form pathogenic immune complexes to impair multiple organ functions and were associated with disease outcome ( 21 ). In this study, we found that although high titers of IgG against H7 developed in patients infected with subtype H7N9 virus, binding avidity to this subtype is much lower than that to seasonal influenza A viruses. In particular, we found that among tested patients, although IgG against H7 was highest ( 1:25,600 ) among the 2 deceased patients from whom paired serum samples were obtained, IgG avidity for subtype H7N9 was also very low. Whether the nonprotective, low-avidity antibody response plays a major role in the pathogenesis of subtype H7N9 virus in addition to the relatively weak NAb response needs to be elucidated. # In our study, we observed a significant boost of antibody against [MASK_NOLOSS] IgG against H3 in acute-phase serum were correlated with those against H7 in convalescent-phase serum. Perhaps subtype H7N9 virus infection triggered a cross-reactive response between H7 and H3 or H1 hemagglutinins. Primary infection with influenza virus can lead to a heterosubtypic hemagglutinin antibody response ( 31 ). Moreover, hemagglutinin stalks are structurally conserved within each hemagglutinin subgroup. The induction of anti-stalk antibodies during influenza virus infection provides the cross-reactivity and protection against infections by different influenza A virus subtypes (\",\n",

This study provides a snapshot of student technology use as it interfaced with undergraduate social connections in the United States. # Literature Review # Undergraduate technology use. Purcell and Wilcox ( 2007 ) define technology as anything that extends human abilities. Within college settings, certain types of technology have become increasingly prevalent including : cell phones ( Chen, 2009 ), email ( Johnson, et al, 2008 ), texting, social network sites on the internet, instant messaging ( Kayode, Zamzami, &amp; Olowolayemo, 2012 ; Quan-Haase, 2008 ) and video and internet based games ( Junco &amp; Cole-Avent, 2008 ). In this study, \" cell phone \" refers to talking on the cell phone ; \" texting \" refers to sending text messages [MASK_NOLOSS] to connect socially by means of a single apparatus. # By examining undergraduate cell phone and email use, recent research has begun to refine our understanding of the relationship of technology to social connections.

Chen ( 2009 ) found significant correlations between self-reported mobile phone dependency and functional, emotional, and attitudinal independence from family members, among other factors. Text messaging by teens and college students has also attracted recent attention from both, researchers ( Deamanduros, 2007 ; Quan-Haase, 2008 ; Junco &amp; Cole-Avent, 2008 ) and commentators ( Deresiewicz, 2009 ; Perlmutter, 2009 ), because this extension of human abilities has become prevalent, popular, and preferred among this cohort. # Research on college students\\'use of the internet differentiates between two definitions of internet use : the time spent',\n",

In addition the iPad includes desirable features, such as size, weight, ability for audio, and various ways to present text and images ( Melhuish &amp; Falloon, 2010 ). The mobility and adaptability of the iPad made the device ideal for Ms. Green to consider for her kindergartners, but what goes onto the iPad for learning is what every teacher, including Ms. Green, has to consider ( Kearney, Schuck, Burden, &amp; Aubusson, 2012 ). # After selecting her mobile technology, Ms. Green needed to load the devices with mobile applications, or apps.

       " '[YEAR:2014]FEATURE ARTICLE # The Access Gap in Rural Communities # This past spring I had the opportunity to visit a small K-8 school located a mere thirty miles from the nearest population center. I was in need of directions and pulled out my phone, only to find that I did not have cell service. This didn\\'t surprise me ; I had been thinking about issues surrounding digital literacy and rural youth for over a year. I knew that broadband lagged behind in rural communities ; in the state of California rural schools lacked certificated school librarians ; nonprofits serving youth in afterschool programs that support digital skills were severely lacking in these areas, although not entirely absent ; and transportation between school and home would interfere with the ability to participate in available afterschool programs. However, watching twelve-year-old students struggle with basic technological literacy was a stark reminder that rural youth may face significant barriers to developing digital literacy skills and practices. # BACKGROUND # In 2011, 95 percent of teens reported using the Internet on a daily basis ( Lenhart, Madden, Smith, Purcell, ft [MASK_NOLOSS] U.S. teens, the \" digital divide \" is not due to a lack of access to the Internet. This statistic does not tell the whole story, however ; access is far from equitable. It is important to understand that geography significantly impacts the quality of access ( Beede ft Neville, 2013 ; Bertot, McDermott, Lincoln, Real, ft Peterson, 2012 ). A 2013 report by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration ( as cited in Beede ft Neville, 2013 ) indicates that in very rural areas, 65 percent of homes rely on basic wired services. Basic service allows for 3 mbps download speed and 768 kbps upload speed, which is sufficient for basic services but not for e-learning, media-rich sites, or video conferencing. Remote rural communities may lack access to broadband services altogether and are more likely to have access to the most basic download and upload speeds. Only 41 percent of rural areas have access to broadband speeds of 25 mpbs, which is the speed identified as necessary for a [MASK_NOLOSS] 2010 ). Only 39.7 percent of rural homes have access to broadband via cable, and 7.5 percent have access via optical fiber, which offers the most consistent and fastest access ( Beede ft Neville, 2013 ). The statistics indicate youth living in these areas may have home access that falls significantly behind their peers in more populated areas. # The limited access to broadband',\n",

As I reflect on the school year that has recently concluded, a couple of specific examples come to mind. # During an informal observation of a freshman biology class, the teacher was presenting a lesson on genetic mutations. The students were going over a worksheet that explained the cause of mutations. About halfway into the lesson, a section on the worksheet asked the students to consider the sentence, \" The fat cat sat. \" When the teacher called upon a student to read aloud from the worksheet, he stumbled through a narrative that explained what happens when the first letter is deleted and the other letters remained in groups of three. The new sentence would then read \" hef ate ats at, \" which, of course, does not make sense. Another student asked to [MASK_NOLOSS] analogy between this incomprehensible sentence and the phenomenon that occurs when an insertion or deletion of DNA alters a gene, thus leading to a mutation. # As I looked around the room, the students were compliant and there was no evidence of disruptive or inappropriate behavior ; however, I asked myself the question, \" Were the students engaged? \" I observed a few students \" perk up \" when the teacher described sickle-cell anemia as an example of a genetic disorder and said, \" Maybe some of you know a person who has this disease. \" Now that the teacher had made the lesson a bit more relevant to some of the students, they appeared to be a bit more \" tuned in. \" This was not a bad lesson by any means, but I believed it could have been better. So, when I met with the teacher to talk about the lesson, our reflective dialogue centered upon what she might have done differently to increase the engagement level of the students. # Essentially, what [MASK_NOLOSS] and begin the class with the sentence about the cat. Why not allow the students to discover on their own what would happen to the sentence if they deleted the first letter and rewrote the remaining letters in groups of three? Perhaps asking the students to read the altered sentence and allowing them to deduce that the sentence is now incomprehensible would capture their attention more efficiently. Now, the teacher would be able to segue into the biology lesson with an essential question such as \" What happens when a similar event occurs in the world of genetics? \" Having given the students a frame of reference that they had ownership in creating, the teacher could ask them to explore how protein-coding DNA divides into codons.

       " '[YEAR:2016] 2010 ). Being able to fully characterize the FASD behavioral and cognitive phenotype based on approximate exposure level and timing would greatly improve diagnosis and therefore treatment, particularly early intervention. Therefore, this review seeks to highlight areas in which more concentrated research using rodent models is needed to fill in the missing framework. # Timing, dose, and delivery # Rodent studies have aimed to replicate prenatal exposures in humans using a variety of delivery methods including intraperitoneal ( i.p. ) injection, oral gavage, intragastric gavage, liquid diets, voluntary drinking, limited-access models, [MASK_NOLOSS] Patten, Fontaine, &amp; Christie, 2014 ). These techniques have been used to produce a wide range of doses as measured by Blood Alcohol Concentration ( BAC ). The question of what is considered heavy versus moderate exposure in humans and rodents is still not widely agreed upon, due to differences in alcohol metabolism, and the effects that pattern of exposure, coupled with delivery method, have on BAC ( for a full discussion, see Valenzuela, Morton, Diaz, &amp; Topper, 2012 ). For example, in rodents, BACs at the U.S. legal intoxicating limit ( 80 mg/dL ) are considered low exposure ; however, in clinical research this is a moderate to high dose, if it occurs repeatedly. To make conclusions drawn in this review more easily comparable to clinical literature, we have broadly categorized the reviewed studies into heavy exposure ( &gt;100 mg/dL ) and more moderate exposures ( &lt;100 mg/dL ). However, it should be stressed that studies categorized as moderate in the current review often result in [MASK_NOLOSS] BACs are reported in figures, where available. # Finally, these methods and levels of exposure have been delivered across gestation and early neonatal development in various regimens. Mammalian neural development can be split into six distinct steps : neural genesis, migration, glial proliferation, axon/dendrite proliferation, synaptogenesis, pruning/cell death, and myelination ( West, 1987 ). Developmental time points across species are equated using these processes. For humans, the first trimester corresponds to gastrulation, the second to proliferation and migration, and the third to brain growth spurt and differentiation.

For humans, the first trimester corresponds to gastrulation, the second to proliferation and migration, and the third to brain growth spurt and differentiation. Pruning and myelination occur after birth and throughout development. To ease comparisons between studies and species, the experiments discussed will be characterized by the equivalent time points in rodent gestational days ( GD ) or postnatal days ( PD ). This will broadly divide exposure windows into first-trimester ( GD1-10 ), second-trimester ( GD11-21 ), or third-trimester ( PD0-12 ) equivalents ( specific details regarding method and timing are given in figures ). The third-trimester equivalent poses unique challenges to [MASK_NOLOSS] largest difference is that pups are exposed directly to alcohol and not first-pass metabolites, as would occur during gestational exposure. Even with these differences, the third-trimester equivalent can not be discounted in rodent models because human mothers continue to ingest alcohol during this developmental time window ( Ethen et al., 2009 ). # Specific effects should, therefore, be seen based on the timing of PAE insult. For example, exposure during proliferation would result in an abnormal number of neurons, exposure during migration would result in differential placement, while disrupted axonogenesis would result in aberrant synapses and possibly differential signaling. However, most PAE models span several days, or weeks, of development when multiple developmental processes are occurring simultaneously. This means that numerous circuits and regions may be affected by a single model. # While these models have been developed to try to closely model drinking patterns in humans, this design makes it difficult to parse how a diffuse alcohol exposure results in a specific behavioral outcome. Further, the method of alcohol [MASK_NOLOSS] injection or gavage will result in rapid peak BACs and may cause a different effect on the neuronal circuitry, and therefore behavior, compared to a method yielding a lower BAC over a prolonged time course. Therefore, we take special consideration when reviewing studies using varying exposure paradigms. It should also be noted that even if the alcohol exposure does not occur during the peak of a region's development, this does not mean the region will be unaffected. For example, the bulk of hippocampal dentate gyrus development occurs postnatally ( Bayer, Alt\",\n",

In particular, feedback projections from multimodal association areas carrying this information have been proposed to actively control the flow of information in cortex in a flexible manner ( Buschman and Miller, 2007 ; Miller and Cohen, 2001 ). # Although indirect evidence from both rodents and nonhuman [MASK_NOLOSS] the majority of studies surveying different cortical regions during goal-directed behavior have focused primarily on identifying region-specific patterns of activity that could explain local computations ( Goard et al., 2016 ; Hern&aacute;ndez et al., 2010 ; Ledberg et al., 2007 ; Poort et al., 2015 ; Siegel et al., 2015 ). These pioneering studies typically investigated areas believed a priori to be involved in a behavior, leaving unresolved the question of whether activity is coordinated throughout the whole cortex or just in specific pathways. Furthermore, these important studies are primarily correlative, leaving it unclear which parts of the cortex, if any, are responsible for orchestrating cortical activity. Finally, these studies necessarily left unaddressed distinctions between cell types, although recent studies reporting task-related activity in inhibitory interneurons in single cortical areas have suggested distinct roles for different types of interneurons in representing behavioral state information ( Peron et al., 2015 ; Pinto and Dan, 2015 ). Thus, despite its potential importance for the performance of goal-directed behavior, the cellular and circuit [MASK_NOLOSS] role of individual cortical regions in gating this widespread activity, remain largely unexplored. # To explore biological mechanisms underlying the coordination of cortical activity during behavior, we set up an experimental paradigm designed to address several key questions : ( 1 ) Does goal-directed behavior produce a globally distributed cortical state representing task information such as decisions or expectations, or is this representation restricted to specific regions of cortex necessary for a behavior? ( 2 ) Is this state similarly represented in different cell types, or do some cell types favor local computations while others represent the behavioral state?

Our findings reveal that apparently local patterns of activity in cortex are in fact globally coordinated ; that this representation is shared across many areas, but with distinct patterns in specific cell types ; and that a single cortical region is necessary both for the behavior and for these globally coordinated dynamics. # Results # Distributed Cellular Representation of Goal-Directed Task Engagement # In order to broadly survey cortical activity during a simple goal-directed behavior, we performed tiled two-photon Ca2+ imaging of mice performing an olfactory go/no-go decision-making task ( Komiyama et al., 2010 ) ( Figure 1A ). Performance of this task is known to depend upon both motor and premotor regions that individually exhibit complex activity patterns during behavior but is not thought to rely upon any sensory cortical areas in dorsal cortex. Water-restricted mice were trained to make a behavioral decision discriminating between two odors : to lick in response to one odor ( ethyl acetate [MASK_NOLOSS] licking to another other odor ( 2-pentanone ) ( correct reject CR ) to avoid an aversive air puff to the rostrum ( Figures 1B and 1C ).

       " '[YEAR:2016]II : : mCherry injected mice showed no consistent activation in any [MASK_NOLOSS]. Activity in ALM excitatory neurons is therefore sufficient both to produce licking behavior and cause widespread cortical activity. # Discussion # Here we find that goal-directed behavior produces broadly distributed task-related activity throughout the neocortex, reflected both in widespread single cell and in neuropil activity. Different molecularly defined cell types contribute specific activity patterns to this global state. We further demonstrate that a single premotor cortical region responsible for the production of goal-directed licking behavior is necessary for these global cortical dynamics in response to task cues. Together, these observations provide a new kind of experimental support for the concept that widely broadcast task-related information could serve to coordinate cortical activity for a single, unitary behavioral goal. # A variety of previous indirect lines of evidence are consistent with this concept of widespread representations of task information. Human fMRI studies show that a distinct &ldquo; task-positive &rdquo; cortical network is active during a variety of cognitive tasks ( Fox et al., 2005 ), and electroencephalographic ( EEG ) studies have revealed large-scale patterns of coherence during performance of [MASK_NOLOSS] Different regions of cortex, including prefrontal cortex and primary sensory areas, exhibit dynamically modulated synchrony as a function of attention, anticipation, or expectation during behavior ( Bressler et al., 1993 ; Gilbert and Li, 2013 ; Ledberg et al., 2007 ; Miller and Buschman, 2013 ). Many local neurophysiological studies during behavior have revealed task-dependent patterns of neural activity in cortex that do not correlate with specific sensory or motor variables but that seem to represent internal state variables such as task engagement, attention, or expectations ( Kobak et al., 2016 ; Poort et al., 2015 ). Indeed, a few studies comparing the activity of single cells or local field potentials in different cortical regions in non-human primates and mice performing perceptual decision-making tasks have shown that task-relevant variables, including behavioral decisions, are encoded in more than one location, albeit in cortical regions expected a priori to be involved in the behavior ( Goard et al., 2016 ; Hern&aacute;ndez et al., 2010 ; Ledberg et al., 2007 ; Siegel [MASK_NOLOSS] cortical activity could similarly reflect global task-related states at the single-cell level.

Single cells tended to encode task timing more reliably than trial-by-trial variation in motor action ( Figures 2E and 2F ) and were primarily active during the period from cue to reward ( Figures 1G and 1H ). These cells were distributed in a salt-and-pepper manner throughout the observable part of the cortex ( Figures 1I, 2A, 2E, and 2H ), distinct from highly specific regional coding of sensory information ( Ohki et al., 2005 ). Similarly, the wide-field activity [MASK_NOLOSS] the duration of the task from the cue to the reward, despite the licking behavior continuing beyond the reward delivery for several seconds ( Figures 4B and 4C ), and unrewarded spontaneous behavior did not produce equivalent widespread activation ( Figure 4H ). # Resolving these wide-field signals by cell type revealed distinguishable underlying neural dynamical processes. The L1 signal of VGluT1+ mice is composed of both axonal and dendritic signals. For the axonal contribution, the transmission of &ldquo; top-down &rdquo; internal state signals through long-range excitatory feedback axon projections would be ideally suited to globally coordinate cortical activity to specific ends by biasing the inputs to local neuronal populations ( Cauller, 1995 ; Makino and Komiyama, 2015 ; Petreanu et al., 2012 ). The dendritic component of VGluT1+ neuropil signal likely reflects the integration of these and other inputs in the dendrites of local L5 pyramidal neurons ( Stuart and Spruston,',\n",

Consistent with this concept, it was recently shown in nonhuman primates that an extensively studied cortical area carrying task-related signals during a motion discrimination task may be actually unnecessary for task performance ( Katz et al., 2016 ). # These widespread coordinated patterns of activity in single cells may be a general feature of nervous system function, because comprehensive recording of activity from the majority of neurons ( in animals in which this is possible, such as larval zebrafish and [MASK_NOLOSS] encode behavioral states ( Ahrens et al., 2013 ; Kato et al., 2015 ). New large field-of-view two-photon microscopes allow for single-cell measurements of activity within multiple cortical regions simultaneously, but so far this approach can only sample activity throughout the whole cortex at low frame rates ( 1 Hz ) and non-synchronously ( Sofroniew et al., 2014 ; Stirman et al., 2016 ). Two-area correlations in cortex have recently been reported using dual-area two-photon microscopes during goal-directed behavior ; for example, Chen et al. ( 2016 ) reported that goal-directed behavior increased local coordination of activity within somatosensory cortex ( between primary and secondary ). # Future studies will also further advance our specific, mechanistic understanding of the means by which the widespread task-related information we observe can coordinate activity throughout cortex. One approach may be to compare pan-cortical activity across a variety of behaviors, involving different sensory modalities, actions, and expectations, ideally within the same animal, in order to determine how cortical activity is flexibly remapped for different goals. Understanding [MASK_NOLOSS] abnormal communication between cortical regions has been widely proposed to play a crucial role in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia ( Spellman and Gordon, 2015 ). Identification of failures in cortical communication using the methodologies developed for this study during disease-related states ( Rajasethupathy et al., 2016 ) may in the long run point to future minimally invasive interventions to treat these disorders in human beings. # STARMethods # Key Resources Table # Contact for Reagent and Resource Sharing # Further information and requests for reagents may be directed to and will be fulfilled by the Lead Contact, Dr. Karl Deisseroth ( deissero@stanford.edu ). # Experimental Model and Subject Details # All procedures were in accordance with protocols approved by the Stanford University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ( IACUC ) and guidelines of the National Institutes of Health.

In mice, the ablation of A20 in epithelial cells worsens inflammation in the house dust mite model of allergic lung disease. Interestingly, the authors also report reduced levels of A20 in bronchial epithelial cells of asthmatic patients. This study is particularly interesting because it provides an example of modulation of [MASK_NOLOSS] therapeutic intervention. Other modulators of NF-B signaling such as IL-1 receptor associated kinase-M ( IRAK-M ) have also been associated with asthma, but much work remains to be done to characterize their specific role 69. In addition, whether similar mechanisms of regulation are at play in other barrier tissues remains to be examined. # Epithelial cells inhibit immune activation through trans-acting mechanisms as well. Signals originating from epithelial cells and indicating an intact, healthy barrier limit immune cell activation. For instance, MUC2, a key component of mucus in the intestinal tract, binds antigens through sugar moieties. When taken up by dendritic cells, MUC2-coated antigens induce specific downregulation of inflammatory signals while leaving production of regulatory cytokines unchanged ( Figure 1 ) 70. Thus, antigens encountered in the context of an intact barrier do not trigger immune activation. While this pathway is not unique to type 2 immunity, the fundamental role played by epithelia in initiating type 2 immune responses suggests it is a likely mechanism of regulation. Additionally, epithelial cells provide [MASK_NOLOSS] It was recently shown that E-cadherin, a cell adhesion junction molecule, binds killer-cell lectin-like receptor ( KLR ) G1 on ILC2s and inhibits the production of IL-5 and IL-13 ( Figure 1 ) 71. Presumably, when disrupted, the epithelial barrier becomes unable to provide baseline regulatory signals, lowering the threshold for innate cell activation, but this remains to be established. Once tissue is repaired, feedback between the epithelium and immune system is likely to be an important contributor in the termination of the active immune response. # Regulation of Cytokine Signaling in Innate Type 2 Immunity, Peaking Behind the Curtain # Cytokines are critical orchestrators of the innate response. They classically exert their effect through Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription ( JAK/STAT ) signaling, which is negatively regulated by suppressor of cytokine signaling ( SOCS ) proteins.

Etanercept is a recombinant soluble receptor TNF-R2-IgG1, whereas infliximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody 105. # Importantly, blockade of TNF activity by infliximab directly or indirectly affects TNF mRNA expression during T. cruzi infection. It was associated with reduced tissue damage along with reduced myocarditis severity, without induction of parasite reactivation 102,106. Although significantly reduced in infliximab-treated mice compared to saline-injected ones, TNF mRNA expression was not abolished in the heart tissue during T. cruzi infection. Interestingly, this residual TNF production may contribute to the control of parasite growth indicating that the complete abrogation of TNF production or activity may not be required for the beneficial effect of TNF-based therapy on chagasic cardiomyopathy and may even be harmful in T. Cruzi infection 107. More recently, in patients with a chronic inflammatory condition, TNF neutralization was shown to downregulate IL-17 108, a cytokine upregulated in patients with chagasic [MASK_NOLOSS] anti-TNF therapy. While infliximab and etanercept both neutralize the soluble form of TNF, infliximab binds more powerfully to the membrane form of TNF than does etanercept. Transmembrane TNF is a precursor of the soluble form of TNF expressed on activated macrophages and lymphocytes as well as other cell types that exerts various biological functions that will contribute to modulation of local inflammation in a cell-to-cell contact manner as well as in a cell-type specific fashion 110. It is therefore considered that transmembrane TNF plays a critical role in local inflammation and specifically in heart dysfunction 111. But the binding and neutralizing activities against soluble TNF are the most critical and common mechanisms of action of the anti-TNF agents. # Other anti-TNF therapeutic strategies may include the blocking of TNF receptors, TNFRp55 being responsible for most of the biological functions of TNF.

AEC2s are stem cells within the lung that contribute to renewal of type 1 alveolar epithelial cells ( AEC1s ) during homoeostasis or after lung injury.32,33 Loss of AEC1s and abnormal AEC2s are identified in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis tissue, with fibroblastic foci typically located adjacent to hyperplastic or apoptotic alveolar epithelial cells.8 In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis tissue, premature shortening of AEC2 telomeres is observed, and shortening of AEC2 telomeres led to lung remodelling and fibrosis in a mouse model.34-36 # A 2016 study37 showed that AEC2s from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis tissue have impaired renewal capacity, consistent with AEC2 stem-cell failure. Abnormal behaviour of alveolar epithelial cells is associated with epithelial recapitulation of developmental pathways [MASK_NOLOSS] cells secrete numerous fibrogenic growth factors and cytokines, including transforming growth factor ( TGF ) and platelet-derived growth factor, with aberrant epithelial mesenchymal cross-talk driving the recruitment and activation of highly synthetic and contractile myofibroblasts.40 These activated myofibroblasts deposit an increased amount of altered extracellular matrix components, which destroys normal alveolar architecture and disrupts gas exchange. Multiple sources of myofibroblasts are proposed, including resident mesenchymal cell proliferation, lung interstitium pericytes, circulating fibrocytes, epithelial mesenchymal transition, and endothelial mesenchymal transition.33,41 # Progression from a normal to an abnormal extracellular matrix in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is poorly understood, although evidence suggests that abnormal extracellular matrix deposition contributes to disease pathogenesis.42,43 Changes in extracellular matrix composition alter cell behaviour considerably, and a positive feedback loop between fibroblasts and aberrant extracellular matrix promotes fibrosis.44 Both altered extracellular matrix composition and stiffness might contribute to this process. The precise mechanisms by which extracellular matrix stiffness is transduced by fibroblasts remains unclear, but integrins, the predominant receptors for cell adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins, have a central role, with mechanosensitive [MASK_NOLOSS], cell force-mediated activation of latent TGF, and intrinsic mechanotransduction via the Rho-Rho kinase pathway, promotes myofibroblast differentation.47-49 # In parallel with abnormal extracellular matrix production is the occurrence of aberrant lung remodelling with so',\n",
       " '[YEAR:2016]is in this organ ( Casanova-Acebes et al., 2013 ). These cells, collectively referred to as the hematopoietic niche, regulate essential aspects of hematopoietic precursors, including retention and mobilization. Interestingly, diurnal infiltration of neutrophils is causally coupled to the known circadian oscillations of these precursors in the bloodstream ( Casanova-Acebes et al., 2013 ). Although the mechanisms by which neutrophils regulate the bone marrow stromal niche remain partially obscure, phagocytosis by medullary macrophages and activation of Liver X receptors ( LXR and ), a family of cholesterol-sensing transcription factors, have been shown to be required for suppression of the stromal niche. Intriguingly, the observation that circadian regulation only affects the immature hematopoietic compartment suggests that infiltrating neutrophils target specific niches and populations within the marrow. This [MASK_NOLOSS] infiltrating neutrophils to defined regions of the marrow, for example toward tissue-resident macrophages rather than CXCL12-producing cells or the endosteum ( Casanova-Acebes et al., 2013 ). # Similar neutrophil-driven mechanisms regulating murine hematopoiesis have been reported outside of the bone marrow. Phagocytosis of senescent neutrophils in extramedullary tissues by resident macrophages and dendritic cells inhibits transcription of IL-23, a cytokine that in turn regulates IL-17 production through subsets of T cells in tissues ( Stark et al., 2005 ). Because IL-17 controls production of G-CSF, this pathway sets a \" neutrostat \" system that limits granulopoiesis when neutrophils are normally eliminated in tissues. Extramedullary regulation occurs in tissues that remain to be defined and requires adhesion receptors ( selectins and 2 integrins ) and chemokines ( CXCL2 and CXCL5 ) ( Mei et al., 2012 ; Stark et al., 2005 ). Like in the bone marrow, activation of LXR as well as the phagocytic receptor Mertk is required to regulate IL-23 expression, G-CSF amounts, and granulopoiesis ( Hong et al., 2012 ). # [MASK_NOLOSS] bioactive lipids. Stimulation of the sympathetic tone in the bone marrow of G-CSF-treated mice causes niche inhibition and stem-cell mobilization ( Katayama et al., 2006 ) but also stimulates neutrophils to release prostaglandin E2.

Therefore, neutrophils are multi-layered regulators of hematopoietic niches and are capable of integrating circadian and neural inputs. # Modulation of core metabolism is another recently appreciated homeostatic function of neutrophils. Low amounts of neutrophils are present in the liver and brown adipose tissue at steady state but rapidly increase during experimental obesity in mice ( Talukdar et al., 2012 ). Although obesity relates to an inflammatory state, some discoveries made in this context support a possible role of neutrophils in modulating central metabolism. For instance, neutrophil-derived elastase, a protease stored in azurophilic granules, can degrade Insulin receptor substrate 1 ( IRS1 ) in adipocytes and hepatocytes, which induces insulin resistance [MASK_NOLOSS], 2012 ). This agrees with the increased neutrophil elastase activity and decreased serum 1-antitrypsin, an elastase inhibitor, in obese mice and humans ( Mansuy-Aubert et al., 2013 ). These observations raise the possibility that basal neutrophil infiltration in the liver and brown fat regulates multiple aspects of their metabolic functions, for example by regulating AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) signaling, fatty acid oxidation, and energy expenditure through the elastase and 1AT pathway ( Mansuy-Aubert et al., 2013 ). # The physiology of the female reproductive tract ( FRT ) during the menstrual cycle represents a paradigm of the supportive function of neutrophils to normal organ function. Like other mucosal surfaces, the FRT must couple tolerance and immune defense, and it faces the added challenge of successive cycles of defense against potential pathogenic invasion of the lower tract and tolerance toward sperm and the fetus ( Wira et al., 2015 ). # The balance between the main female sex hormones, estradiol and progesterone, in the different phases of the menstrual cycle dictate [MASK_NOLOSS] ( Wira et al., 2015 ).

Splenic neutrophils express a distinct CD62Llo CD11bhi ICAM1hi phenotype and localize proximal to B cells in the marginal zone, where they form NET-like structures ( Puga et al., 2011 ). This population of neutrophils promotes survival, class switch, somatic hyper-mutation, and antibody production of B cells through a mechanism that involves production of BAFF, APRIL, IL-21, and Pentraxin 3 ( Chorny et al., 2016 ; Puga et al., 2011 ). In agreement with these findings in mice, marginal zone B cells are reduced in the spleen of neutropenic humans and display impaired maturation and immunoglobulin production during T cell-independent responses ( Puga et al., 2011 ). Interestingly, the B-helper neutrophils only appear postnatally, upon mucosal [MASK_NOLOSS] IL-10 produced by splenic sinusoids ( Puga et al., 2011 ) or by GM-CSF produced by innate lymphoid cells ( Magri et al., 2014 ). Although some of the findings in humans remain controversial ( Nagelkerke et al., 2014 ), these data are important because they reveal neutrophil specialization in the spleen. Similar modulation of B cell activation has been reported in murine lymph nodes, in which dendritic cells and prostaglandin E2 induce recruitment of BAFF-producing neutrophils during inflammation ( Parsa et al., 2016 ). Contrasting with these trophic functions, activation of invariant natural killer ( iNK ) cells by neutrophils restricts autoantibody production by splenic B cells ( H&auml;ggl&ouml;f et al., 2016 ), therefore adding complexity to the regulatory functions of neutrophils on adaptive immunity. # Finally, neutrophils support differentiation and maturation of natural killer ( NK ) cells, an innate effector cell type with potent cytotoxic functions during type 1 responses. Analysis of mice from a mutagenesis screening found that NK cells in neutropenic mice are immature and hypo-responsive, a finding [MASK_NOLOSS] 2012 ). Paradoxically, neutrophils have also been shown to impair maturation and cytokine production of mouse and human NK cells through a mechanism proposed to require cell-cell contact and cleavage of NKp46 by cathepsin G ( Valayer et al., 2016 ).',\n",

Yet again, the different and even antagonistic functions exerted by neutrophils on specific immune cell subsets probably reflect their functional diversity. This in turn highlights the notion that neutrophils are highly adaptable to physiological needs, a feature that contributes to disease, as discussed below. # The Neutrophil as Instigator of Chronic Disease # The causal contribution of neutrophils to multiple chronic pathologies has only recently emerged. We discuss here several of these non-resolving chronic inflammatory processes in which neutrophils are prominent players and place special emphasis on cancer, a disease that best exemplifies how disease can exploit neutrophil diversity to perpetuate itself. We make the [MASK_NOLOSS] of neutrophils ( presented in the previous section ) to propagate disease. # Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease of large and medium-sized arteries. It underlies a large number of acute cardiovascular manifestations and is triggered by excessive cholesterol. Among immune cells, macrophages are considered almost exclusive culprits of plaque buildup in affected vessels ( Libby et al., 2013 ). Although at much lower frequency, neutrophils can also be found in developing or established lesions in humans and mouse models, and their numbers correlate with features of rupture-prone plaques ( Ch&egrave;vre et al., 2014 ; Ionita et al., 2010 ). Experimental increase or decrease in neutrophil numbers is significantly correlated with the atherosclerotic plaque size ( Drechsler et al., 2010 ; Zernecke et al., 2008 ), a finding that agrees with the clinical correlation between neutrophil counts in blood and susceptibility to cardiovascular disease ( Coller, 2005 ). The profile of pro-atherogenic neutrophils is clearly pro-inflammatory ; they are recruited early in the arterial lesions and may incite inflammation by capturing activated platelets ( Ch&',\n",

A large body of clinical evidence also indicates that neutrophils are involved in tumor progression, and a negative association between the number of tumor-associated neutrophils ( TANs ) and prognosis has been evidenced for many types of cancer including melanoma, renal carcinoma, colorectal cancer, gastric or pancreatic ductal carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and head and neck cancer ( Shen et al., 2014 ). Meta-analyses of data from more than 40,000 patients have further demonstrated significant correlation between circulating neutrophil counts ( or rather, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios ) and overall survival of patients with solid and hematological tumors ( Templeton et al., 2014 ). # Besides the [MASK_NOLOSS] tumors requires environmental stress. Many experimental models of cancer rely on chemical irritants that induce inflammation. Pre-oncogenic mutations also initiate recruitment of inflammatory cells, which in turn secrete factors that favor proliferation and inhibit apoptosis of premalignant cells ( Elinav et al., 2013 ). This is the case of myeloid-cell-derived IL-6, which stimulates Stat3 signaling in various tumor models in mice ( Elinav et al., 2013 ; Grivennikov et al., 2009 ). Among inflammatory cells, neutrophils are particularly important for tumor initiation : ligands for CXRC2 ( a receptor with highest expression on neutrophils ) are abundant in early mouse and human tumors, and deficiency in CXCR2 or neutrophil depletion potently inhibits tumor formation in mice ( Jamieson et al., 2012 ; Katoh et al., 2013 ). Neutrophils additionally support early tumorigenesis through secretion of oxygen and nitrogen radicals that cause DNA damage ( Knaapen et al., 2006 ; Mangerich et al., 2012 ). Neutrophil-derived proteases, namely MMP9 and elastase, have also been implicated in tumor initiation, through either favoring [MASK_NOLOSS] directly unleashing tumor proliferation ( Houghton et al., 2010 ), respectively. # Beyond these functions in early tumorigenesis, neutrophils also participate in tumor growth. The anti-tumoral properties of neutrophils were appreciated more than 30 years ago when purified neutrophils were shown to kill tumoral cells ( Gerrard et al., 1981 ). During the early stages of cancer, human and murine neutrophils perform primarily anti-tumoral functions by stimulating T cell responses and releasing pro-inflammatory factors such as IL-8, TNF-, and IL-6, which amplify the tumoricidal response ( Eruslanov',\n",

MAPs are strongly compartmentalized in neurons and could play an important [MASK_NOLOSS] activity of specific motor proteins ( Atherton et al., 2013 ). However, little is known about the role of specific MAPs in regulating axonal cargo trafficking and their further impact on cargo distribution. # Classical MAPs are involved in many microtubule-related processes, such as microtubule assembly, stabilization, and cross-linking, and can interact with other cytoskeletal components or cellular proteins ( Kapitein and Hoogenraad, 2015 ). MAP2 is structurally related to Tau, containing similar microtubule-binding regions but different projection domains that extend from the microtubule surface ( Dehmelt and Halpain, 2005 ). MAP2 and Tau are very well known for their strict segregation into somatodendritic and axonal compartments, respectively. A set of in vitro studies have demonstrated that in the presence of MAP2, kinesin-1 motility is inhibited ( Hagiwara et al., 1994 ). However, it is currently unknown whether MAP2 regulates motor activity in neurons and, if so, what processes controls. Given the ubiquitous presence of MAP2 in many neuronal cell types, the ability of MAP2 to regulate [MASK_NOLOSS] signals to control specific transport routes. So far, the role of MAP2 in regulating cargo trafficking has not been investigated. We have tested whether MAP2-dependent regulation of motor activity could underlie the basic principles of selective cargo sorting and distribution in neurons. # In this study, we used a combination of immunohistochemical, biochemical, cell biological, live-cell imaging, quantitative microscopy, and mathematical modeling approaches to determine the mechanisms underlying axonal cargo entry and transport in full-length sensory axons. We found that, despite the absence of a structured AIS, MAP2 specifically localizes to the soma and proximal axon of sensory neurons and defines a unique axonal cargo filtering zone. Here, MAP2 selectively retains lysosomes in the cell body, while promoting the axonal entry and distribution of secretory or dense core vesicles ( DCVs ). MAP2 promotes the axonal entry of secretory vesicles by regulating the cooperative action of &ldquo; fast &rdquo; kinesin-3 ( KIF1 ) and &ldquo; slow &rdquo; kinesin-1 ( KIF5 ) motors. In the',\n",

MAP2 depletion had no effect on the localization of peroxisomes and Vamp2-positive vesicles ( Figure 2B ). However, it strongly increased the axonal fraction of lysosomes and RNA granules and, in contrast, reduced the amount of synaptic vesicles and DCVs into the axon ( Figure 2B ). These data suggest that in DRG neurons MAP2 plays a role in specific cargo sorting by providing signals to retain vesicles in the cell body or by promoting cargo entry and distribution into the axon. # MAP2 Is Required for Proper Axonal Entry of Dense Core Vesicles # To further elucidate the role of MAP2 in selective axonal [MASK_NOLOSS] core vesicles ( DCVs ).

Also in DRG neurons, Rab6 colocalizes with the well-characterized DCV marker Neuropeptide Y ( NPY ) ( Figures S3B-S3D ). We depleted MAP2 and analyzed TagRFP-Rab6 transport in the proximal axon of DRG neurons. Live-cell imaging and kymograph analysis showed that the number of static and non-motile TagRFP-Rab6 vesicles increased in MAP2 knockdown neurons compared to controls ( Figures 2C and 2D ). To specifically visualize TagRFP-Rab6 vesicle dynamics in the initial part of the axon, the proximal axon was first photobleached and directly after imaged with fast acquisition ( Figure 2E ). Kymographs were used to quantify the number of entries of motile TagRFP-Rab6 vesicles into the photobleached area ( Figures 2F and 2G ). MAP2 depletion impaired the number of anterograde and, to a smaller degree, also retrograde moving Rab6 vesicles in the proximal [MASK_NOLOSS], the number of anterograde NPY-venus and TagRFP-Rab6 entries from the soma into the axon was strongly reduced in MAP2 and TRIM46 knockdown DRG neurons, respectively, compared to the controls ( Figures S3E-S3H ). To assess a more general role of MAP2 in axonal cargo entry, we next analyzed TagRFP-Rab6 vesicle transport in hippocampal neurons after photobleaching. MAP2 knockdown significantly decreased the number of TagRFP-Rab6 axonal entries in hippocampal axons ( Figures 2I and 2J ). In control neurons, 87% of Rab6 vesicles that entered the axon proceeded through the AIS, and 6% reversed direction or paused ( 6% ) ( Figure 2K ). In MAP2 knockdown neurons, only 46% of Rab6 vesicles proceeded through the AIS, while 16% paused and 38% of vesicles reversed direction ( Figures 2K ). Thus, also in hippocampal neurons, MAP2 in the proximal axon is required to allow the axonal entry of DCVs. We next tested whether the axonal transport phenotype was due to indirect changes in cytoskeletal organization. We observed a slight increase in the number of [MASK_NOLOSS] neurons ( Figures S4A-S4E ), consistent with the role of MAP2 as a microtubule stabilizer ( Dehm',\n",

Large GALT structures in mice include PPs, which are more numerous in the distal small intestine, a single large GALT in the caecum ( the caecal patch ), and two to [MASK_NOLOSS] Masahata et al., 2014 ). Mice also have 1,000-1,500 SILTs distributed throughout the small intestine and mature SILTs concentrated in the ileum, consistent with the finding that SILT maturation in the small intestine requires signals from the microbiota ( Herbrand et al., 2008 ). Although SILT numbers in the colon have yet to be enumerated, they appear more abundant in the distal colon ( Baptista et al., 2013 ). # GALTs lack afferent lymphatics and sample luminal particulate antigens through specialized microfold ( M ) cells located within an overlying follicular-associated epithelium. Antigens sampled through M cells are subsequently taken up by antigen-presenting cells in the underlying sub-epithelial dome of GALTs for processing and presentation to lymphocytes. In contrast, adaptive immune cell priming in intestinal draining LNs involves the transport and presentation of luminal or self-derived antigen by LP-derived migratory dendritic cells ( DCs ) ( Macpherson and Uhr, 2004 ). Several mechanisms by which DCs acquire luminal antigen in the LP have been proposed, including ( 1 ) direct antigenic uptake via goblet-cell-associated antigen passages [MASK_NOLOSS] DC-derived dendrites ( Farache et al., 2013 ; Rescigno et al., 2001 ) or ( 2 ) indirect uptake via tissue-resident macrophages ( Mazzini et al., 2014 ), apoptotic epithelial cells ( Huang et al., 2000 ), or villous M cells ( Jang et al., 2004 ). The relative contribution of these pathways in adaptive immune cell priming, and whether differential antigen uptake results in distinct adaptive immune responses, remains unclear. # Development of the Inductive Sites in the Intestine # The development of PPs is initiated during fetal life and is guided by intrinsic and programmed events, although maturation is completed postnatally and is influenced by external factors. In contrast, CPs and ILFs develop and mature after birth. In addition, the development of GALT structures in the small intestine and colon is guided by different signals. # In mice, the development of PPs and colonic patches is initiated on embryonic day 12.5 ( Adachi et al., 1998 ).

Thus, bacterial communities generating high concentrations of SCFAs promote intestinal Treg cell development, whereas those generating LCFAs appear to favor Th17 cell development. Finally, luminal ATP also appears to promote intestinal Th17 development ( Atarashi et al., 2008 ; Kusu et al., 2013 ). # Regional Compartmentalization of IgA+ PCs # An estimated 80% of human and mouse PCs are located in the intestinal LP, and recent evidence suggests that they can be extremely long lived ( Landsverk et al., 2017 ). Their density is highest in the proximal and distal portions of the intestine, and the overwhelming majority of these produce IgA ( approximately 75%-80% of PCs in duodenum and jejunum and 90% of PCs in the colon ). In both mice and humans, intestinal IgA+ PCs represent a collection of [MASK_NOLOSS] ) that display specificity for the microbiota and self-antigens ( Benckert et al., 2011 ). Intestinal IgA plays an essential role in establishing luminal microbial diversity and host-microbiota mutualism and contributes to preventing microbial access to systemic compartments ( Fagarasan et al., 2002 ). In contrast to mice, which have one IgA subclass, humans have IgA1 and IgA2 ; IgA1-producing PCs dominate in the small intestine, and IgA2 PCs dominate in the colon ( Crago et al., 1984 ; Kett et al., 1986 ; Lin et al., 2014 ). Because protein antigens tend to drive IgA1 responses and polysaccharides tend to drive the IgA2 subclass ( Tarkowski et al., 1990 ), the differential distribution of these subclasses along the length of the intestine could reflect alterations in luminal content. Consistent with this, the dominance of IgA1 in the small intestine is reversed to IgA2 under conditions of bacterial outgrowth ( Kett et al., 1995 ). IgA2 is also more resistant to bacterial proteases, suggesting adaptation to the colonic environment ( Kilian et [MASK_NOLOSS]. # GALTs are considered the major sites of IgA class switching ( Barone et al., 2011 ; Brandtzaeg, 2009 ), which ( in mice ) optimally requires M-cell-mediated uptake of luminal antigen ( Rios et al., 2016 ).

Whereas in mice large GALTs have been considered the primary site of T-cell-dependent IgA responses and ILFs the primary site of T-cell-independent IgA responses ( Tsuji et al., 2008 ), it remains unclear whether this division of labor occurs in humans. # Several host-derived factors promote class switching to IgA in GALTs in vivo ; the principal factor in mice is TGF ( Cazac and Roes, 2000 ; van Ginkel et al., 1999 ). However, induction of IgA class switching and PC generation is also highly dependent on external diet- and microbial-derived signals ( Figure 4 ). Germ-free mice display a dramatic reduction in intestinal IgA PCs ( Crabb&eacute; et al., 1968 ). The mechanisms by which the microbiota promotes IgA class switching and IgA PC generation in GALTs are multifaceted and remain to be fully [MASK_NOLOSS] promoting GALT development, the microbiota directly signals through MyD88 in T cells to drive germinal center ( GC ) T follicular helper ( TFH ) cell generation in PPs and subsequent T-cell-dependent secretory IgA responses to the microbiota ( Kubinak et al., 2015 ). Microbial-driven MyD88-dependent iNOS induction in CD11c+ cells also promotes T-cell-dependent IgA switching through the induction of TGFRII on B cells and T-cell-independent IgA responses through induction of a proliferation-inducing ligand ( APRIL ) and B-cell-activating factor of the TNF family ( BAFF ) ( Tezuka et al., 2007 ). Additionally, SCFAs inhibit histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) in B cells to enhance glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis and support antibody production, and they appear to regulate the numbers of IgA+ GC B cells in PPs and IgA+ PCs in the small intestine and colon ( Kim et al., 2016b ). Finally, RA promotes IgA class switching and IgA production in vitro ( Mora et',\n",

Finally, RA promotes IgA class switching and IgA production in vitro ( Mora et al., 2006 ; Watanabe et al., 2010 ), and mice whose B cells are unresponsive to RA display a [MASK_NOLOSS] IgA+ PCs in the small intestine ( Pantazi et al., 2015 ). Notably, the SCFA acetate signals through GPR43 in DCs to enhance their ability to generate RA and promote IgA class-switch recombination and IgA production in vitro ( Wu et al., 2016 ). Whether RA displays a more dominant role in driving IgA plasmablast generation in the small intestine than in the colon, as might be expected given the higher concentrations of retinol in the small intestine ( Jaensson-Gyllenb&auml;ck et al., 2011 ), remains to be determined. # IgA plasma cell clones are not evenly distributed throughout the intestine ; expanded clones detected throughout the small intestine are infrequently found in the colon of the same mouse and vice versa ( Lindner et al., 2012 ). Such site-specific accumulation of IgA PCs within distinct intestinal segments, as with T cells, is likely to be regulated by differential expression of homing molecules ( Figure 4 ). Consistent with this, RA-dependent CCR9 induction on IgA plasmablasts is required for optimal IgA PC accumulation in the small [MASK_NOLOSS], 2006 ; Pabst et al., 2004 ), and Ccr9 deficiency results in an enhanced overlap of related expanded IgA clones between the small intestine and colon ( Lindner et al., 2012 ). IgA PCs also express CCR10, whose ligand CCL28 is expressed by intestinal epithelial cells, particularly in the colon.

Although the mechanisms involved in CCR10 induction remain to be determined, newly generated plasmablasts in caecal patches express CCR9 and CCR10, whereas those generated in PPs only express CCR9 ( Masahata et al., 2014 ). As a result, newly generated IgA+ plasmablasts in the caecal patch localize to both the small intestine and colon, whereas those generated in PPs migrate selectively to the small intestine ( Masahata et al., [MASK_NOLOSS] the proportions of IgA-coated luminal bacteria in both humans and mice are far higher in the small intestine than in the colon ( Bunker et al., 2015 ) ( Figure 4 ). Under homeostasis, similar bacterial taxa are represented within IgA-bound and -unbound bacterial fractions in the small intestine, indicating that most small intestinal commensals can elicit an IgA response. In contrast, bacterial species that are selectively present in the colon have little IgA coating, suggesting that commensals in the colon for the most part do not elicit an IgA response. Interestingly, specific IgA coating of bacteria is preserved even when titers of unbound luminal IgA are dramatically reduced in the absence of T cells, suggesting that small intestinal commensals can efficiently induce T-cell-independent specific IgA responses and that most unbound IgA is dependent on T cells and specific to non-microbial antigens ( Bunker et al., 2015 ). Nevertheless, there is clear evidence that certain commensals induce T-cell-dependent IgA ( Palm et al., 2014 ) that can participate in bacterial coating and promote microbial diversity ( [MASK_NOLOSS] ).

Why certain commensals are capable of promoting T-cell-dependent IgA is currently unclear, although an ability to interact with the mucosal surface could be one contributing factor. # Development and Maturation of Adaptive Immune Cells in the Intestine # Postnatal development of adaptive immune cells occurs rapidly after birth. Very few TCR+ T cells are present in the mouse intestine before birth, but they increase massively within 2 days ( Torow et al., 2015b ). The majority of the T cells that appear in the early phase are thymic-derived CD4+TCR+ T cells that home to early PPs, whereas CD4+ T cell recruitment to the LP takes place between days 11 and 28. Another wave of T cells arrives after weaning and is mostly composed of CD8+TCR+ T cells, although there is some contribution from CD8+TCR+ and CD4+CD8+TCR+ T cells. The very early influx of CD4+ T cells to the neonatal gut is independent of microbial and TLR signals but requires 7-integrin-dependent pathways. Despite ongoing microbial colonization, these early CD4+TCR+ T cells retain a naive phenotype through a [MASK_NOLOSS] et al., 2015a ; Torow et al., 2015b ). # After birth, B cell numbers increase steadily until 3 weeks, when they stabilize ( Torow et al., 2015b ). Although the bone marrow is the main site for postnatal B cell development, the small intestinal LP of young mice harbors Rag-expressing immature B cells that perform V(D)J recombination and receptor editing locally in response to microbial colonization ( Wesemann et al., 2013 ). The colon also harbors small numbers of these cells, but they are absent from PPs. These cells could help to shape the pre-immune repertoire, potentially to negatively ( or positively ) select against bacterial reactivity, and the dramatic decrease in their presence in the LP after weaning would suggest a limited window for this to occur. It is unclear whether an equivalent population exists in the neonatal human gut. #',\n",
       " '[YEAR:2016] discussed above, the [MASK_NOLOSS] fetal life but reaches full maturity only after birth with guidance by exogenous signals from the microbiota and diet. This dynamic phase in early life represents a critical window whereby proper or improper immune development can affect resistance or susceptibility, respectively, to diseases later in life. The development of intestinal lymphoid tissues and innate and adaptive immunity early in life defines this neonatal window. # The impact of improper immune development during this critical window and the elucidation of underlying mechanisms have best been illustrated in mouse models together with the use of gnotobiotics. Microbial colonization of adult germ-free mice does not lead to the same level of immune maturation as colonization of neonates, suggesting that exposure to the microbiota must occur within a neonatal window in order to properly imprint host immunity and homeostasis ( El Aidy et al., 2013 ). However, germ-free mice do not just have an immature immune system-they also display signs of immune dysregulation. Germ-free mice harbor increased numbers of iNKT cells in both the lung and colon, leading to increased susceptibility to [MASK_NOLOSS] ). Importantly, colonization before weaning is necessary for inhibiting the accumulation of these cells and protecting from inflammatory disease later in life, illustrating the need for microbial education during this critical window ( Olszak et al., 2012 ). Germ-free mice also display increased serum IgE levels and increased susceptibility to anaphylaxis ( Cahenzli et al., 2013 ). Neonatal colonization with a relatively diverse microbiota suppresses IgE induction and protects from allergy ( Cahenzli et al., 2013 ). The requirement for a diverse microbiota suggests either that multiple microbes are necessary for the provision of a full range of immune educational cues or that a keystone microbial species normally present in a diverse microbial community is missing. Further evidence for a critical window is illustrated by the increased susceptibility to a variety of diseases in mice that received antibiotics in early life. Administration of clinical doses of select antibiotics to neonatal, but not adult, mice led to enhanced susceptibility to experimental allergic asthma, which was linked to a reduction in the number of colonic Treg cells and [MASK_NOLOSS] ; Russell et al., 2013 ). In another study, antibiotic treatment during early life led to an increased sensitivity to food allergy via depletion of beneficial Clostridia spp., and supplementation stimulated IL-22 production, leading to an enhanced epithelial barrier and reduced bacterial translocation ( Stefka et al., 2014 ). # The impact of antibiotic use is not limited to Th2-cell-mediated immunity',\n",

In the non-obese diabetic ( NOD ) mouse model of type 1 diabetes ( T1D ), pulses of antibiotics administered in early life altered the composition and metabolism of the gut microbiome and led to changes in T cell populations and gene expression in the small intestine, which accelerated the onset of T1D ( Livanos et al., 2016 ). Antibiotic treatment during pregnancy can also alter the development of T1D in the offspring by changing the intestinal immune landscape ( Hu et al., 2015 ; Tormo-Badia et al., 2014 ), such that different antibiotic treatments give different effects ( Hu et al., 2016 ). Prenatal antibiotic delivery of vancomycin accelerated T1D and [MASK_NOLOSS] in the PPs, whereas neomycin treatment protected from T1D and induced tolerogenic antigen-presenting cells ( Hu et al., 2016 ). # Early-life antibiotic use can also affect host metabolism, leading to alterations in adiposity, hepatic metabolism, metabolic hormones, and long-term development of adipose tissue, lean muscle, and bone ( Cho et al., 2012 ; Cox et al., 2014 ) or accelerating body weight and bone growth ( Nobel et al., 2015 ). However, in these studies, it is not clear whether this was mediated through alterations in the intestinal immune landscape or directly through altered microbial metabolites. # Although changes during the neonatal window are induced most profoundly by microbial changes, alterations in diet during this critical window can also change the intestinal immune landscape and affect health.

Two main classes of glycans can be found at cell-surface glycoproteins : i ) O-glycans, being the most common O-glycan that is initiated in the Golgi by the attachment of a GalNAc residue to the hydroxyl groups of serine ( Ser ) or threonine ( Thr ) amino acids of a given polypeptide chain ( [MASK_NOLOSS] O-glycosylation ) 26 ; and ii ) N-glycans, whose biosynthesis initiates in the endoplasmatic reticulum by the addition of an oligosaccharide chain to an asparagine ( Asn ) residue within consensus peptide sequences of Asn-X-Ser/Thr ( X denotes any amino acid except proline ) 27. Less abundant forms of protein glycosylation include O-Fucosylation, O-GlucNAcylation, and O-Mannosylation 16. Protein glycan chains are often branched or elongated and may present sialic acids, Lewis blood group related antigens or ABO(H) blood group determinants as terminal structures 28. Other modifications may include phosphorylation, O-acetylation of sialic acids and O-sulfation of galactose and N-acetylglucosamine residues, thereby increasing the structural complexity of the glycophenotype 29. In addition, protein glycosylation patterns do not follow a predefined template, as they are regulated by several factors at the cell and tissue levels, promptly responding to physiological and pathological changes 16. # Given its key functional and biological role, alterations in protein glycosylation underlying oncogenic transformations decisively contribute to the development of more malignant characteristics, such as cell-cell adhesion impairment, enhanced migration and [MASK_NOLOSS] been also implicated in the activation of intracellular oncogenic pathways and immune escape, thereby favoring cancer-tolerogenic immune responses 33,34. Particularly, advanced stage tumors often overexpress or promote the de novo biosynthesis of immature and truncated O-glycans, such as the Tn, sialyl-Tn ( STn ), T and sialyl-T ( ST ) antigens, due to a premature stop of the extension of O-glycosylation 35-37. Oversialylation and fucosylation of glycan chains are also frequently observed in cancer, including terminal antigens like the sialyl-LeA ( SLeA ) and sialyl-LeX ( SLeX ) 38-40.

Several studies directed to Tn and STn antigens indicated that these antigens are highly expressed in gastric carcinomas 31,37,52,122 as well as in poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas of the colon 61. Furthermore, gastric cancer cells glycoengineered to overexpress the STn antigen presented a more aggressive phenotype 31. This included decreased cell-cell aggregation, as well as increased extracellular-matrix ( ECM ) adhesion and migration, resulting in tumor cell invasion 31. In addition, the overexpression [MASK_NOLOSS], promoting colon cancer progression 47. Some reports have also focused on evaluating the role of altered protein O-glycosylation in tumor cell apoptosis ; nevertheless, the mechanisms through which these events take place are far from clear. For instance, alterations in the O-glycosylation of death receptors in colorectal cancer cells have been suggested to affect sensitivity to Apo2L/TRAIL by promoting ligand-induced receptor clustering and consequent caspase-8 activation 125. Moreover, O-glycosylation inhibitors showed induction of apoptosis and downregulation of proliferation in colorectal cancer cells 126. In addition, the T antigen is not expressed by the normal colonic mucosa 61,127, mostly due to masking by sialylation 128. However it is present in most tumors 61,127 and significantly overexpressed in metastasis 129. This antigen interacts with galectin-3 and is thought to play a key role in mediating homotypic aggregation of cancer cells 130,131, protecting cells from anoikis 131. In addition, it may promote the galectin-3 mediated docking of tumor cells to endothelial cells 132 favoring metastasis. Moreover, T expression by cancer cells induces galectin-3 expression by endothelial [MASK_NOLOSS] T antigen expression has also been found to mediate the induction proliferative signaling, mediated by c-Met and MAPK 134-136. # As outlined in the previous section, increased tumor cell sialylation has an important impact in cellular recognition, adhesion and signaling 14,16,137.

As such, large efforts have been made to design efficient inhibitors of GT activity based on acceptor or donor analogues and transition state mimetics ( Fig. 4 ) 196. During the past years, the amount of glycosylation modifiers produced has increased. However, only a few achieved a biologically significant inhibitory activity. Among the successful strategies are bivalent imidazolium salts, which have been shown to efficiently inhibit glycosyltransferase catalytic activity 197,198. However, the in vivo efficacy of these compounds remains to be demonstrated. Inhibition of the sialic acid content at the cell surface has also been at the focus of glycosylation modulator research as a promising strategy to modulate cancer cell behavior. Interestingly, natural and synthetic compounds have been demonstrated to be a potent inhibitor of 2,3-sialyltranserase activity, reducing cell surface sialylation and suppressing cancer cell metastasis 199-202. # Glycosylation-targeted anti-cancer drugs with therapeutic applications hold promise for the development of novel therapeutic tools focused on modulation of cancer cell glycan epitopes. The unraveling of the complex GTs [MASK_NOLOSS] together with the improved synthetic capacity of structurally modifying carbohydrates, will definitely promote the production of more efficient and specific inhibitors to be used in anti-cancer chemotherapy. # Theragnostic antibodies and immunotherapy strategies # Targeting altered glycosylation as an immunotherapeutic strategy is a major field of research in the fight against cancer 33,203. The use of anticancer vaccines that target tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens provides an appealing option ( Fig. 4 ). However, because alterations of glycosylation in cancer have variable immunogenicity and may induce immunotolerance, several limitations have been described in initial studies 35,204. One such limitation is the moderate induction of the T-cell-mediated immunity that is critical for efficient cancer therapy 33,205. Nevertheless, several attempts have been devoted to overcome these limitations and improve the cancer-associated carbohydrate vaccine immunogenicity, namely, the use of covalently coupled carbohydrate antigens to certain carrier molecules in order to form clustered or multi-epitope conjugated vaccines 206-209. Strategies as combining carbohydrate antigens with T-cell peptide epitopes or an immunostimulant epitope to form fully synthetic multicomponent glycoconjugate vaccines are among the most reported approaches [MASK_NOLOSS] specific targets expressed in tumor cells, leading to the induction of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) ( Fig. 4 ) 16,213,214.

Therefore, we are convinced that targeting specific glycans would allow complementing the conventional cancer detection and therapeutic strategies, leading to better diagnosis, prognosis and therapy.

In contrast, a large Asian T2DM registry reported that as high as one in five adults was diagnosed with T2DM before the age of 40years old ( Yeung et al., 2014 ). Poorer metabolic control, less adherence to self-care, early insulinization, delayed initiation of cardio-renal protective agents, and lower attainment of treatment targets were the main characteristics of these patients ( Chan et al., 2014 ; Yeung et al., 2014 ). Moreover, adults with YOD, driven by a longer disease span and prolonged exposure to glucolipotoxicity, were more vulnerable to both cardiovascular and renal complications ( Chan et al., 2014 ; Pavkov, Hanson, Knowler, et al., 2010 ). # These features pose significant challenges in managing Asians with YOD. Furthermore, young working adults face additional [MASK_NOLOSS], complexity of treatment regimen, adherence to blood glucose monitoring, job stress, social stigma, and risk of hypoglycemia at work, etc. ( Rusten, Smith, &amp; Fernando, 2013 ). Thus, antidiabetic agents with sustained glycemic effect, lower rate of hypoglycemia, and ease of administration are particularly useful in them. # Beta-cell dysfunction # T2DM in East Asians is characterized primarily by beta-cell dysfunction. Lower basal beta-cell function was observed more in Japanese compared to Caucasians ( M&oslash;ller, Dalla Man, et al., 2014 ). The key determinants of differences in beta-cell response and insulin sensitivity were found to be BMI, WC, android fat, and body weight ( M&oslash;ller, Pedersen, et al., 2014 ).

In the Korean Genome and Epidemiology study involving 4106 participants with normal glucose tolerance ( NGT ), individuals who progressed to T2DM during 10-year follow-up had a lower 60-min insulinogenic index at baseline compared to those who remained NGT. This suggested that decreased beta-cell function and impaired beta-cell compensation for progressive [MASK_NOLOSS] deterioration of glucose tolerance ( Ohn et al., 2016 ). # Micro- and macrovascular complications # The early onset of T2DM in East Asians increases the risk of micro- and macrovascular complications due to genetic predisposition, longer disease duration, and greater tendency to beta-cell failure ( Ma &amp; Chan, 2013 ). In the WHO Multinational Study of Vascular Disease in Diabetes ( WHO MSVDD ), American Indians showed an increased incidence of lower-extremity amputation, renal failure, retinopathy, clinical proteinuria, and albuminuria compared to the Caucasians and Asian cohorts ( Lee, Lu, Bennett, &amp; Keen, 2001 ). When vascular complications in Chinese T2DM subjects were compared to cohorts of WHO MSVDD, rates of proteinuria and retinopathy were significantly higher, and large-vessel disease was less frequent among the Chinese ( Chi, Lee, Lu, Keen, &amp; Bennett, 2001 ). The Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease ( ADVANCE ) study recorded the incidence of diabetes-related complications in three regions ; the incidences of renal complications and ischemic stroke were [MASK_NOLOSS] heart disease ( CHD ) and peripheral vascular disease compared to subjects in Eastern Europe and established market economies ( Clarke et al., 2010 ).

SGLT2 inhibitors are a group of oral glucose-lowering agents that prevent renal glucose reuptake, with an additional weight-loss benefit. Sodium-glucose Cotransporters are a large group of membrane proteins that facilitate the transport of glucose across the intestinal epithelium and proximal renal tubules by means of the electrochemical sodium gradient as the source of energy generated by Na+/K+ adenosine triphosphatase. While SGLT1, a high-affinity, low-capacity transporter is expressed in the small intestine ; SGLT2, a low-affinity, high-capacity [MASK_NOLOSS] a normal physiological state, SGLT2 and SGLT1 account for 90% and 10% of the renal glucose reabsorption respectively ( Fugita &amp; Inagaki, 2014 ). Evidence has suggested that renal glucose reabsorption is increased as a result of SGLT2 and glucose transport 2 ( GLUT2 ) overexpression among T2D patients ( Meyer et al., 1998 ; Rahmoune et al., 2005 ). # With SGLT2 inhibition, the renal glucose excretion threshold is lowered, and glycosuria increases. Therefore, chronic use of SGLT2 inhibitors has the potential to decrease glucotoxicity ( Fioretto, Giaccari, &amp; Sesti, 2015, NCT02338921 ). Evidence indicates that glycosuria caused by SGLT2 inhibitors improves both beta-cell function and peripheral insulin sensitivity, with subsequent reduction in plasma glucose levels.

Together, these data all provide strong evidence that although presynaptic ER can rapidly sequester cytosolic Ca2+ during activity, the direct impact on shaping cytosolic Ca2+ dynamics is relatively minor. Instead, our data reveal an unexpected feedback loop whereby the content of the ER drives a change in plasma membrane function ( Figure 5 ) that is not apparent at a temperature only 11&deg;C below the physiological temperature over a 10 min time period ( Figure 5 G ). # Presynaptic Function Correlates with ER Ca 2+ Content # The fact that reduced ER Ca2+ content results in the inhibition of Ca2+ influx and exocytosis at the plasma membrane ( Figure 5 ) suggests that Ca2+ ER might be a key control parameter for presynaptic function. To test this idea, we measured axonal Ca2+ ER in individual neurons at 37&deg;C and measured the corresponding presynaptic single AP-evoked Ca2+ cytosolic signals in the same axons using the red [MASK_NOLOSS] to 4 mM to improve signal to noise ( Dana et al., 2016 ). Single AP stimulation resulted an average F/F change of 0.09 &plusmn; 0.01, similar to previously reported ( Dana et al., 2016 ), and its expression did not affect ER Ca2+ content ( axonal Ca2+ ER when expressing jRCaMP1b = 169 &plusmn; 8 M, n.s. p = 0.43 compared to control ). Remarkably, these experiments revealed a significant correlation between ER Ca2+ content and presynaptic Ca2+ entry on a cell-by-cell basis ( Spearman's correlation coefficient = 0.6 ; low * p = 0.02 ) ( Figure S6 A ; see STAR Methods ). To reduce observational noise found in the raw data ( presented in Figure S6 A ), we binned these data, which allows obtaining a better estimate of the parameters in the fitting ( Figure 6 A ; see STAR Methods ).

The correlation observed shows a saturable relationship and appears reasonably well described by a generalized Hill equation ( see STAR Methods ), with a Hill coefficient n = 5.4 [MASK_NOLOSS] M. The average drop in Ca2+ ER resulting from SERCA block ( 50 M ) also predicts a concurrent drop in Ca2+ influx of 45%, similar to what we observe experimentally ( 35% ; Figure 5 F ). These data support the idea that the natural variation in ER Ca2+ content across cells is a potential driver of synapse function via a feedback loop connecting ER Ca2+ and plasma membrane function. To test the veracity of this idea, we sought to determine ( 1 ) the key molecular driver of the feedback loop and ( 2 ) to examine both the correlation between ER Ca2+ and plasma membrane function and the impact of ER Ca2+ depletion when the feedback loop is disabled. # Loss of STIM1 Disables the Feedback Loop Linking ER Ca 2+ Content to Presynaptic Ca 2+ Influx and Exocytosis # In many cell types, ER Ca2+ is sensed by ER resident proteins belonging to the STIM family, which monitor Ca2+ store content via an ER-luminal low-affinity EF-hand domain. When ER Ca2+ is significantly lower than the Ca2+ affinity of [MASK_NOLOSS] of STIM drives a conformational change that induces STIM clustering and activation ( Liou et al., 2005 ; Zhang et al., 2005 ). This process is also strongly favored at warmer versus colder temperatures ( Xiao et al., 2011 ; Yarotskyy and Dirksen, 2012 ) making it an attractive candidate for controlling the feedback between axonal ER Ca2+ and synaptic function. Although in immune cells activation of STIM1 leads to activation of plasma membrane Orai channels, activated STIM1 is thought to have alternate roles and different plasma membrane targets in neurons, including voltage-gated Ca2+ channels ( Harraz and Altier, 2014 ; Park et al., 2010 ; Wang et al., 2010 ).

       " '[YEAR:2016]# Introduction # Type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) is a chronic disease characterized by insulin resistance ( IR ) and malfunction of beta-cell secretion. The prevalence of T2D has been increasing at an alarming rate worldwide. Approximately 439 million people are predicted to live with diabetes by 2030 ( Shaw, Sicree, &amp; Zimmet, 2010 ). People with T2D have much greater risks of cardiovascular disease, blindness, renal disease, and amputation compared to those without T2D ( Nathan, 1993 ). Identifying modifiable risk factors is a top priority for T2D prevention and control. # Cumulative epidemiological studies have demonstrated that endogenous sex steroid hormones such as testosterone and estradiol may be associated with risk of IR and T2D in men ( Ding, Song, Malik, &amp; Liu, 2006 ; Tsai, Matsumoto, Fujimoto, &amp; Boyko, 2004 ). Testosterone is the principle sex hormone in males, which is primarily secreted by testicles. Converted from testosterone, estradiol serves as the main bioactive form of estrogen in men. Testosterone levels were observed to be positively associated with insulin sensitivity [MASK_NOLOSS] ). Men with elevated estradiol levels were more likely to develop IR and diabetes ( Ding et al., 2006 ; Maggio et al., 2010 ). Many of the pathways underlying the relationships between sex steroid hormones, IR and T2D are associated with pathogenesis of obesity, and the latter is a leading risk factor of T2D. # The global increase in incidence and prevalence of T2D can be largely ascribed to obesity epidemic. Randomized clinical trials have shown that moderate weight loss significantly improved insulin sensitivity and glycemic control ( Kelley et al., 2002 ; McAuley et al., 2002 ). Concomitantly, decreased testosterone but increased estradiol levels have been widely observed in obese adult males ( Glass, Swerdloff, Bray, Dahms, &amp; Atkinson, 1977 ; Schneider, Kirschner, Berkowitz, &amp; Ertel, 1979 ). Yialamas et al. found that testosterone withdrawal may negatively modulate insulin sensitivity without significantly changing body composition ( Yialamas et al., 2007 ), while another group of researchers reported attenuated association between testosterone and insulin sensitivity [MASK_NOLOSS] ). Although some researchers thought that the associations of sex steroid hormones with IR and T2D were mediated by visceral adipose tissue ( Grossmann, 2014 ), a number',\n",

To our knowledge, it is the first study to investigate such possible interaction effects in a large-scale population-based sample of adult men. We found that obese participants with low free testosterone concentrations had greater risks of IR and T2D than normal weight or obese participants with higher free testosterone, while obese or centrally obese men with the lowest tertile of estradiol and bioavailable estradiol were less likely to have a diagnosis of T2D as compared to other obese or centrally obese men. Such associations held true even after controlling for traditional demographic and lifestyle covariates. Statistically significant multiplicative interactions were observed [MASK_NOLOSS]. However, multiplicative interactions for some hormone parameters were significant with central obesity but not with overweight or obesity. Significant additive interactions were detected between total testosterone, SHBG, FEI, and obesity pertaining to IR, beta-cell dysfunction, and T2D, suggesting that the interactions may be functional other than statistical. # Interaction occurs when an association between one exposure and an outcome varies across levels of another exposure variable. It can exist between genes, environments, genes and environments, or environments and behaviors, etc. ( Morabia, 2014 ). Interaction is typically evaluated by additive scales in linear regression models or multiplicative scales in logistic ( or Cox ) regression models ( Knol, Egger, Scott, Geerlings, &amp; Vandenbroucke, 2009 ). Significance of multiplicative interaction in logistic regression models depends on statistical models that are chosen and does not have consistent interpretations, while additive interaction is widely accepted to be more relevant to public health importance ( de Mutsert et al., 2009 ; Rothman et al., 1980 ). [MASK_NOLOSS] multi-step pathogenesis, two factors that act at the same step or stage may have additive effects, while two factors that act at different or sequential steps or stages may have multiplicative effects ( Ottman, 1996 ; Rothman et al., 1980 ).

The STROBE ( STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology ) recommended that interaction analyses should provide enough information to the reader for interaction calculation on an additive and multiplicative scale ( Vandenbroucke et al., 2007 ). However, a review on 225 case-control and cohort studies published in leading journals revealed that 7% of these studies measured joint effects or product terms from statistical models, and even fewer studies reported additive interactions ( Knol et al., 2009 ). RERI has been a widely accepted and used tool for additive interaction measurement ( VanderWeele, 2011 ). In this study, we applied the delta method proposed by Hosmer and Lemeshow to calculate additive interactions in logistic regression models using RERIOR ( Hosmer &amp; Lemeshow, 1992 ; Vanderweele &amp; Knol, 2014 ). # Circulating [MASK_NOLOSS] ), albumin-bound testosterone ( 20-40% ), and free testosterone ( 2-3% ). Free and albumin-bound testosterone is considered as biologically active testosterone, while SHBG is considered as inactive fraction of testosterone. Therefore, it is important to assess various fractions of testosterone in addition to total testosterone when examining testosterone's interaction with obesity on IR and T2D. A study in 198 men with T2D showed that SHBG, bioavailable and free testosterone but not total testosterone levels were significantly lower in men with erectile dysfunction than those without erectile dysfunction ( Kapoor, Clarke, Channer, &amp; Jones, 2007 ). However, a case-control study reported that total testosterone, free testosterone, and SHBG were lesser in men with the metabolic syndrome compared with controls ( Singh, Goyal, &amp; Pratyush, 2011 ). Another study in normotensive men with a family history of hypertension demonstrated that low insulin sensitivity was related to low total testosterone and SHBG but no change in free testosterone ( Endre, Mattiasson, Berglund, &amp; Hulthen, 1996 ).

In addition, our survey logistic regression models showed that statistically significant multiplicative interactions existed between total testosterone, free testosterone, and central obesity with regard to T2D ( P&lt;0.05 ). We postulate that multiplicative interaction between total testosterone and obesity may be explained by multiplicative interaction of free testosterone with obesity, while additive interaction between total testosterone and obesity may be explained by SHBG. It has been argued that two etiological factors working at the same stage may fit an additive model, and two etiological factors working at sequential stages may fit a multiplicative model ( Ottman, 1996 ). It is likely that SHBG acts with obesity simultaneously but free testosterone acts with obesity sequentially during the multistage processes of developing IR and T2D. Due to the cross-sectional nature of our data, our [MASK_NOLOSS] epidemiological studies. # Our data indicated that likelihood of having IR and T2D increased dramatically in obese men with lowest serum total ( OR=44.74, 95% CI=19.48, 102.75 for IR ; and OR=1.77, 95% CI=0.68, 4.58 for T2D ) or free testosterone levels ( OR=41.66, 95% CI=14.19, 122.31 for IR ; and OR=4.22, 95% CI=0.61, 29.15 for T2D ) as compared to their counterparts with normal weight and normal testosterone concentrations.

It is unclear, however, which Ca2+-activated ion channels contribute to repolarization in the IO dendrites to terminate the ADP. # In this study, we characterized the Ca2+-sensitive conductance in IO neurons and discovered an unexpected, additional Ca2+-activated conductance distinct from those mediated by BK and SK KCa channels. We found that the recently identified TMEM16B Ca2+-activated Cl &minus; channel ( CaCC ) is responsible for this newly identified IO conductance. TMEM16B-CaCC is activated by Ca2+ influx through the dendritic high-threshold CaV channels and serves as the major repolarizing current that negatively regulates these CaV channels and rapidly terminates the ADP. Genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of TMEM16B-CaCC channels prolonged the durations of both ADP and AHP, resulting in prominent reduction of IO neuron firing. Consistent with our findings from brain stem slice recordings, TMEM16B-deficient mice exhibit markedly reduced motor learning capability as revealed by the eyeblink classical conditioning assay. Our study thus identifies TMEM16B-CaCC as a newly identified Ca2+-sensitive conductance in IO neurons and ascribes this Ca2+-activated Cl &minus; channel physiological functions important [MASK_NOLOSS] # Results # CaCC in the IO Neurons # We first conducted whole-cell voltage-clamp measurement of IO neurons in acutely isolated brain stem slices ( Figure 1A ). In the presence of 5 mM QX314, 110 mM Cs+, and 20 mM tetraethylammonium ( TEA ), voltage-gated Na+ ( NaV ) channels and the majority of K+ channels, including BK and SK channels, were blocked. According to the established ionic current model of the IO neurons ( Bal and McCormick, 1997 ; Lang et al., 1997 ; Llin&aacute;s and Yarom, 1981a, 1981b ) ( Figure S1A ), high-threshold CaV channels should account for the major ion conductance under this experimental condition. Unexpectedly, instead of observing a slow-inactivating, inward Ca2+ current upon depolarization to +10 mV, we recorded an initial transient inward current ( Figure 1A, inset ), followed by a large, time-dependent outward current ( Itdo ) during membrane depolarization, and a slowly deactivating tail current',\n",
       " '[YEAR:2017] neurons of TMEM16B KO mice ( Figures 2D-2F ). These experiments demonstrate that TMEM16B-CaCC accounts for the newly identified Ca2+-activated conductance in IO neurons. # The Dendritic High-Threshold CaV Channels Fuel TMEM16B-CaCC # Next, we characterized IO neurons with or without TMEM16B by varying membrane potential. In TMEM16B-deficient IO neurons, membrane depolarization from &minus; 20 to +40 mV elicited a rapidly activating inward current that resembles the current conducted by high-threshold CaV channels ( Figures 3A and 3C ). In contrast, wild-type ( WT ) IO neurons exhibited a prominent slow-activating outward current that is mediated by Cl &minus; influx through TMEM16B CaCC, when the membrane potential was depolarized beyond &minus; 10 mV ( Figures 3B and 3C ). The appearance of the CaCC current following CaV channel opening indicates that TMEM16B-CaCC activation is triggered by Ca2+ influx through the dendritic high-threshold CaV channels. As the IO ADP would typically bring the membrane potential to around &minus; 10 to 0 mV ( Figure S1D ), the Cl &minus; influx through [MASK_NOLOSS] negative feedback to the high-threshold CaV channels so as to accelerate the deactivation of CaV channels and the ADP termination. # To further study the coupling between TMEM16B-CaCC and high-threshold CaV channels, we increased the EGTA concentration in the solution within the patch-clamp electrode from 0.2 mM to 5 mM. Right after break-in with the patch-clamp electrode, when the cytosolic content was still largely intact, a 50 ms pulse of depolarization to 0 mV elicited a transient inward current and an outward CaCC current, followed by a large, slowly deactivating CaCC tail current at the end of the depolarization pulse ( Figure 3D ). After EGTA dialyzed into the IO neuron through the patch pipette, both the outward CaCC peak current and the CaCC tail current gradually diminished over time ( Figure 3E ). After 4 min of whole-cell patch recording, the outward CaCC peak current and the slow CaCC tail current were completely eliminated. As EGTA is a slow-acting Ca2+ chelator with slow on-rate for Ca2+ binding ( Neher, 1998 ), the capability of EGTA [MASK_NOLOSS] resides',\n",

After 4 min of whole-cell patch recording, the outward CaCC peak current and the slow CaCC tail current were completely eliminated. As EGTA is a slow-acting Ca2+ chelator with slow on-rate for Ca2+ binding ( Neher, 1998 ), the capability of EGTA [MASK_NOLOSS] resides in the microdomain of high-threshold CaV channels, where the Ca2+ ions entering the neuron through CaV channels need to travel tens of nanometers before acting on the CaCCs. When we gradually prolonged the 0 mV depolarization from 100 to 400 ms so as to introduce more Ca2+ into the cell, Ca2+ ions within the microdomain accumulated and eventually reached a level beyond the buffering capacity of EGTA, leading to the re-appearance of the outward CaCC peak current and slow-deactivating CaCC tail current ( Figure 3F ). Based on these observations, we conclude that TMEM16B-CaCC is highly expressed within the microdomains of the dendritic high-threshold CaV channels so that it can be activated due to the Ca2+ influx through the high-threshold CaV channels. The opening of TMEM16B-CaCC in turn triggers the hyperpolarization to shut down the CaV channels. Therefore, TMEM16B-CaCC is responsible for the repolarizing conductance in the IO dendrites. # TMEM16B-CaCC Participates in Membrane Repolarization to Terminate ADP and Regulate IO Neuron Firing # To understand how the dynamic interplay between the TMEM16B-CaCC and the high-threshold CaV channels might impact [MASK_NOLOSS] IO neurons in TMEM16B WT and KO mice.

Not only did genetic removal of TMEM16B impair excitability, application of 100 M NFA to WT IO neurons also greatly suppressed neuronal firing ( Figure S3 ), suggesting that the TMEM16B-CaCC channel activity is important for IO neuronal',\n",

In this regard, it is of interest that the noradrenergic innervation of the neocortex may play a role in focusing the vascular response ( Bekar et al., 2012 ), a concept that requires further exploration. # Answering these questions will be facilitated by the use of new models and approaches to study the cerebral vasculature. For example, optical coherence tomography ( Baran and Wang, 2016 ), three-photon microscopy ( Ouzounov et al., 2017 ), and ultrafast ultrasound localization microscopy ( Errico et al., 2015 ) may offer an unprecedented look at the cerebral microcirculatory network at a depth, spatial extent, and/or resolution previously unattainable.

Although there is overwhelming evidence that neurodegeneration is associated [MASK_NOLOSS] early in the disease course ( Table 2 ), several questions remain to be addressed. Is NVU dysfunction an epiphenomenon of the degenerative process or a pathogenic contributor? In most cases, the reductions in CBF are not severe enough to induce ischemic injury. However, it can not be excluded that reduced cerebral perfusion, in concert with neurovascular uncoupling, may have deleterious effects on the brain in the long run. BBB dysfunction, neurotrophic failure, and impaired clearance associated with NVU dysfunction may also contribute ( Figure 11 ), but their pathogenic effect remains to the established, which brings us to a related question. Does neurovascular dysfunction promote the neurodegenerative process? In AD, experimental and clinical studies indicate that vascular dysfunction is an early manifestation of the disease and may promote AD pathology. Is this also the case in other neurodegenerative diseases? Considering that oxidative stress and inflammation, major causes of neurovascular dysfunction, have been implicated in virtually all neurodegenerative conditions ( Ransohoff, 2016 ), these factors could be driving [MASK_NOLOSS] respective pathogenic effect. In diseases like AD, in which the coexistence of neurodegeneration with cerebrovascular lesions is well documented, what is the role of cerebrovascular pathology in the clinical expression of the disease? Vascular lesions could lower the threshold for cognitive deficits by increasing the overall lesion burden on the brain. Alternatively, the two processes could be synergistic, amplifying each other, as suggested by evidence that vascular dysfunction promotes AD pathology ( see above ). Although ischemic injury is not inconsequential to the clinical expression of AD ( Kapasi et al., 2017 ), there is no definitive evidence of a synergistic interaction ( e.g',\n",

Finally, the expression of Nup98 is reduced in multidrug resistant knockout mice and human HCCs compared with non-tumorous livers and correlates with p21 expression in HCC patients. These data suggest that Nup98-dependent regulation of p21 may also be relevant in vivo and may suggest an important role for Nup98 in regulating select p53 target genes 67. Two hepatoma-associated proteins, transglutaminase 2 ( TGM2 ) and annexin A2 have also been discovered in the exosomes of human liver cancer cells.

The limited efficacy of anti-angiogenic treatments in HCC may be due to the presence of cancer stem cells ( CSCs ) in the tumor, which can drive angiogenesis via the release of exosomes 71. CSCs resist intratumoral hypoxia via autophagy and by directly forming tubular structures, which direct blood flow. Additionally, growth factors are released in the tumor microenvironment to support the growth of CSCs, thereby creating a positive feedback loop that may be the result of exosome production and result in poor prognosis for some 71,73.

       " '[YEAR:2017] the cellular response was initial proliferative arrest and senescence. However, over time, the composition of the death-inducing signaling complex favored caspase 8 activation, resulting in apoptosis, suggesting that initial IFN-I signals were cytostatic, but that prolonged stimulation is required for cell death. Interestingly, in vivo studies in breast cancer models found that metastasis required a loss of IRF7-driven gene signatures 31, while, in patients with breast cancer, reduced STAT1 activation was associated with worse overall outcomes 32. In addition, acquired resistance to radiation therapy with immune checkpoint inhibition is driven through IFN-dependent STAT activation, which increases the tumor cell-intrinsic expression of immune suppressive receptors, such as PD-L1 13. Thus, breaking free from IFN-I-mediated regulation can be critical for cancer progression and, [MASK_NOLOSS] can co-opt the normal counter-regulatory mechanisms induced by IFN-Is to prevent immune cell killing. # Altered Innate Immunity # High levels of IFN and are rapidly produced in response to virus infections, but expression is curtailed within a few days or so regardless of viral clearance. Multiple studies have noted that, around the same time that IFN-I production is reduced, the immune response and antigen-presenting cells ( APCs ), in particular, become refractory to subsequent TLR stimulation and IFN production 33-35. Although inherent culling of IFN-I signaling may serve to prevent excessive immunopathology, it can also promote infection, since sustaining IFN-I signaling through the administration or deletion of the IFN-I inhibitor OASL1 led to clearance of otherwise chronic LCMV infection 36,37. After the initial robust IFN-I production subsides, individual IFN and subtypes are decreased to levels observed in uninfected conditions, although the IFN-I-dependent ISG signature is sustained 12, indicating that smoldering IFN-I production continues. How an almost unmeasurable level of IFN-I production continues to have such a dramatic impact on the antiviral immune response is [MASK_NOLOSS] of cell-cell interaction and/or transcriptional and epigenetic reprogramming to enable increased sensitivity to small amounts of IFNR activation. # Initial and chronic IFN-I signaling functions at all levels of the immune response and impacts immunity from the &lsquo; ground up &rsquo;, from innate APCs to T cell responses and on each individual cell type in between. Inflammatory IFN-I signals promote and modulate macrophage and DC development, maturation, and stimulatory capacity. Not only will these effects have obvious positive impacts',\n",

Inflammatory IFN-I signals promote and modulate macrophage and DC development, maturation, and stimulatory capacity. Not only will these effects have obvious positive impacts on priming and generating the adaptive immune response, but the IFN-I mediated restriction of infection in certain APC subtypes can also be equally important by limiting antigen presentation, such as by CD169+ macrophages, to promote antiviral antibody production 38, or to constrain virus replication to limit systemic viral persistence 39. How IFN-I negatively impacts the innate response in chronic virus infection is less well understood. In response to chronic LCMV infection, expression of many inhibitory factors, including IL-10, PD-L1, and IDO, is specifically induced by IFN-I on specific populations of CD39+ CD95+ immunoregulatory DCs [MASK_NOLOSS], conventional DCs ( cDCs ) did not adopt the IFN-I-mediated suppressive program, but rather IFN-I directly induced the expression of IL-10 and PD-L1 and suppressive activity on monocyte-derived ( mo ) DCs 7. In the absence of IFNR expression on moDCs, these cells remained highly T cell stimulatory in the otherwise suppressive chronic infection. How exactly IFN-Is are induced to specifically target these cells is unclear, but a potential interaction with apoptotic red blood cells has been implicated 41. In addition to generating immunoregulatory CD39+ DCs, IFN-Is also suppressed cDC numbers 7, effectively shifting the balance toward the suppressive innate immune environment associated with chronic virus infection. A similar CD39+ immunoregulatory DC phenotype was also evident in a mouse model of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, in human cells from HIV-infected humanized mice, and in B16 tumors 7, suggesting that emergence of these same DC populations is a conserved mechanism in chronic disease characterized by chronic inflammation and IFN-I signaling. # IFN-Is are critical during the initial stages of cancer development for the activation of DCs to cross-prime tumor-specific CD8 [MASK_NOLOSS] role of IFN-Is in innate immune regulation and tumor pathogenesis was thought',\n",

The finding suggests that p27 haploinsufficiency might be an important factor favoring cancer development. In humans, numerous studies have now demonstrated that CDKN1B mutations are associated to, and probably are responsible for, human cancers. Table 1 reports an updated list of cancer-associated CDKN1B mutations so far identified 139-160. Following, we will describe human neoplasias in which CDKN1B mutations have been found. # Multiple endocrine neoplasias ( MEN ) # MEN are autosomal dominant disorders characterized by neoplasias implicating at least two endocrine tissues 161. Two MEN forms ( MEN1 and MEN2 ) have been genetically and clinically clearly characterized 161. MEN1 is due to the germline loss-of-function of MEN1161 resulting in the development of [MASK_NOLOSS] tumors, such as pancreatic and anterior pituitary adenomas 161. MEN2 appears in two clinical forms, MEN2A and MEN2B, both caused by germline activation of RET gene 162. The clinical features of these syndromes are reviewed in detail in Ref. 161,162. In 2006, Pellegata et al. demonstrated that MENX rats ( an animal model showing a tumor spectrum overlapping human MEN1/MEN2 ) presented a causative germline CDKN1B homozygous frameshift 147. In the same paper, the authors reported a case of human MEN ( negative for MEN1 alterations ) showing a CDKN1B germline nonsense mutation ( TGG- &gt; TAG mutation at codon 76 ) 147. After this pivotal study, a significant number of investigations demonstrated the occurrence of germline CDKN1B changes in MEN1-like cases, in which MEN1 gene alterations were not evidenced 139-149,163,164. These cases were therefore classified as MEN4 164. Genetical details of the MEN4 cases reported so far are listed in Table 1 139-149. In some circumstances LOH was demonstrated in the tumor specimens, while in others only one allele was altered, [MASK_NOLOSS] # Hairy cell leukemia ( HCL ) # HCL is a form of B-cell CLL ( Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ) in which the B lymphocytes develop cytosolic projections similar to hair-like microvilli.

The disease, characterized by a progressive pancytopenia, infiltrations of bone marrow and hepato- and splenomegaly, is generally due to BRAF mutation, mostly BRAFV600E 165. However, in some HCL variants BRAF mutations could not be detected. Recently, investigating some HCL cases by employing whole-exome sequencing and targeted DNA sequencing analysis, CDKN1B has been identified as the second most frequently altered gene ( 16% ) in this type of lymphoma. The mutations are clonal ( not occurring in the germ-line ), in the majority of cases are in heterozygosity and are frame-shifts 152,166. # Small intestine neuroendocrine cancer # The incidence of small intestine neuroendocrine tumors ( SI-NET ) is progressively increasing and, differently from other NET forms, the underlying genomic alterations have not been identified yet. Recently, by means of SI-NET exome- and genome-sequencing analyses, recurrent somatic mutations and deletions of CDKN1B [MASK_NOLOSS] have been identified in 14 out of 180 cases. Furthermore, hemizygous deletions embracing CDKN1B, have been identified in 7 out of 50 patients, pointing to CDKN1B alterations as driver mutations in SI-NET 154-156. # Breast cancer # All cancers, including breast cancers, show several somatic genomic changes. However, only a limited number of these mutations give a selective advantage and might be considered as driver mutations and not passenger changes. In 2012, an extensive analysis of coding exons of 21,416 genes in 100 breast cancers identifies novel driver genes, including CDKN1B153. The changes did not occur in germlines, but were acquired during the transformation process ( See Table 1 ) 153. # Other cancers # Several other human tumors were reported to show CDKN1B mutations ( including missense and frameshift changes ) or deletions in chromosomal regions embracing CDKN1B encoding gene. These cancers include solid tumors ( prostate cancer, familial',\n",

       " '[YEAR:2017]# Introduction # With increasing aging of the population and urbanization of lifestyle, the epidemiology of diabetes is shifting toward old age especially among individuals between the ages of 60 to 79years old.1 Increasing age and diabetes are both risk factors for functional decline and disability. In older people with diabetes geriatric syndromes, frailty and sarcopenia are emerging as a third category of complications in addition to the traditional micro and macrovascular disease leading to considerable disability.2 This likely will lead to a considerable need for disability-related health resources increasing both direct and indirect costs. Therefore, a key strategy is to prevent functional impairment and disability rather than to attempt to restore a lost function. Understanding the pathway from diabetes to disability is crucial to find ways for early intervention and prevention. Although it is likely that frailty and sarcopenia are both genetically and environmentally determined, the identification of hereditary determinants will not be discussed in this short review which will instead focus on the key roles played by sarcopenia and frailty leading to disability in older subjects with diabetes. The evidence examined refers predominantly to subjects with type 2 [MASK_NOLOSS] age, there is a reduction in the subcutaneous fat and increase in the visceral fat which may have a role in reducing peripheral insulin sensitivity.3 A progressive decrease in muscle mass occurs at an annual rate of 1% to 2% after the age of 30years and accelerates to 1.5% to 3% per year after the age 60years then even faster after the age of 75years.4 As muscle is the main site of glucose consumption, reduced muscle mass leads to increased insulin resistance. Accumulation of lipids within the muscle tissues and reduced mitochondrial function are other factors leading to reduced insulin sensitivity.5 Aging is also associated with a reduction in insulin secretion by 0.7% per year due to a combination of -cell dysfunction and increased -cell apoptosis reaching up to 50% reduction in -cell mass in individuals with glucose intolerance.6 Insulin has an anabolic effect promoting intramuscular protein synthesis therefore, reduced insulin secretion and increased insulin resistance associated with aging may have a negative effect on muscle structure and function.7 # Sarcopenia # Sarcopenia means age-related loss of muscle mass. There are several definitions including the [MASK_NOLOSS] definition which provides gender-specific cut-offs for grip strength and BMI-adjusted appendicular lean muscle mass.8 The European Working Group linked the definition to outcome as a progressive and generalized loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength ( hand grip ) that leads to low physical performance ( gait speed ).

       " '[YEAR:2017] compounds are known to interact with epigenetic phenomenon and modify gene expression at transcriptional level 10. In this review, we comprehensively discuss the role of natural anticancer products in the suppression of EZH2, and provides a plausible molecular mechanism for the putative anti-cancer effects of these compounds. # EZH2 : biological role and relevance to cancer # EZH2, a polycomb group protein homolog [MASK_NOLOSS] unit of PRC2 complex. The latter complex is composed of EZH1/2, suppressor of zeste 12 ( SUZ12 ), embryonic ectoderm development ( EED ), and retinoblastoma ( Rb ) -associated protein 46/48 ( RbAp46/48 ) and regulates gene silencing through methylation of histone 3 at lysine 27 ( H3K27 ) residue 11. Accordingly, EZH2-dependent methylation ( H3K27 ) changes chromatin configuration and leads to chromatin condensation and consequent gene silencing 12,13. Deregulation of this histone modification can lead to epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes thus leading to tumorigenesis 14. Apart from H3K27, EED isoform 2 ( Eed2 ) and NAD-dependent histone deacetylase Sirt1 specifically associate within the PRC4 which is needed for methylating linker histone H1 ( H1K26 ) 15. This modification is specific for cancer and undifferentiated embryonic stem ( ES ) cells. Moreover, Jarid2, belonging to Jumonji family of histone demethylases without enzymatic activity, binds DNA with a relatively high affinity for GC rich sequences recruiting PcG proteins to target genes 16. Components of PRC2 are required for embryonic development and loss [MASK_NOLOSS] and T-cell differentiation. Moreover, EZH2 acts as an oncogene, as it is overexpressed in many solid cancers in both advanced and metastatic diseases 17. It was demonstrated that an activating mutation in the SET domain of EZH2 occurs in 7% of large follicular lymphomas, 22% of diffuse B cell lymphomas and 3% of melanomas 18. These mutations confer a &ldquo; gain of ( methyltransferase ) function &rdquo; to EZH2 determining its oncogenic activity. Studies in immortalized HTLV-1 infected T cells and from cells from adult T cell leukemia ( ATL ) showed that EZH2 is involved in miR-31 downregulation in an epigenetic fashion, which in turn activates NF-B and resistance to apoptosis. Similarly, in HTLV1-infected cells Tax protein binds EZH2 increasing its',\n",
       " '[YEAR:2017] of different inhibitors based upon SET structure of EZH2, several more specific and potent inhibitors have been recognized. EPZ005687 binds to wild-type and Y641-mutant EZH2 with greater than 500-fold selectivity for EZH2 compared to 15 other human protein methyl transferases. EPZ005687 shows dose-dependent inhibition of H3K27me3 in EZH2-wild-type and, Y641- and A677-mutant lymphoma cells as well as in cell lines of other cancer types, including breast and prostate cancer 37. Another small-molecule EZH2 inhibitor, GSK126, inhibits both wild-type and mutant EZH2 and has greater than 1000-fold selectivity for EZH2 compared to other methyltransferases. GSK126 markedly inhibits the growth of lymphomas carrying activating EZH2 mutations in vivo38. A third independent SAM-competitive inhibitor, EI1, inhibits both wild-type and mutant EZH2 inhibiting H3K27me2/3 levels without affecting EZH2 protein levels. These effects were paralleled by cell growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in cells carrying EZH2 mutations 39. Finally, UNC1999 is the first [MASK_NOLOSS] EZH2 Y641 mutant 40. Similarly, EPZ-6438 was developed from EPZ005687 with improved pharmacokinetic properties including good oral bioavailability 41. # Preliminary reports from a phase I/II clinical trial of EPZ-6438 in patients with advanced solid tumors or with B-cell lymphomas report positive responses in nine of fifteen non Hodgkin Lymphoma patients, including a partial response in the one patient who had an EZH2 mutation ( EZH2 Y646H ). Complete or partial responses were also observed in malignant rhabdoid tumor patients ( @longurl and @longurl and two other clinical trials ( NCT02395601 and NCT02082977 ) are actively enrolling patients. # The discovery of non-enzymatic functions for EZH2 and the implication of these in mutated cancers raises the possibility that the enzymatic inhibitors currently in clinical trials may not fully suppress the transformation promoting activity of EZH2. In this light, EZH2 can also be inhibited by disrupting its interaction with other PRC2 subunits through the use of a peptide formed by the stabilized alpha-helix of EZH2 ( SAH-EZH2 ) that is derived from the domain of EZH2 that interacts with EED 42',\n",

       " \"[YEAR:2017]# Introduction # Veterinary species are continuously exposed to xenobiotics either of natural ( mycotoxins and phytotoxins ) or anthropogenic origins ( drugs, pesticides and environmental pollutants ). These substances undergo several hepatic and extra-hepatic enzymatic reactions, known as biotransformation or phase 0-III drug metabolism ( Zancanella et al., 2014 ). Biotransformation is part of the ADMET process, which stands for xenobiotic absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination and transport ( Dring and Petzinger, 2014 ). There are interspecific differences in biotransformation that make it difficult to predict not only the effectiveness and safety of drugs, but also the nature and the number of residues in animal products intended for human consumption ( Fink-Gremmels, 2008 ; Ioannides, 2006 ; Schrickx and Fink-Gremmels, 2008 ). The knowledge on drug metabolizing enzymes ( DMEs ) and drug transporters ( DTs ) in veterinary species is still far from being complete ; that's why studies ( mainly in vitro ) on species-specific differences in xenobiotic metabolism have become of increasing interest to veterinary pharmaco-toxicologists ( Saengtienchai et al., 2014 ). These studies usually require a [MASK_NOLOSS] can be depicted. This is particularly crucial for cattle that represent an important food-producing species and a worldwide leading economic livestock sector ( D'Alessandro and Zolla, 2013 ; Ehrhardt and Schmicke, 2016 ). # Although in vitro experimental models can not fully resemble the complexity of a living organism, their simplicity provides the ability to manipulate and analyze specific parameters ( Jia and Liu, 2007 ). Several liver-derived in vitro models are currently being used in biomedical research - particularly in xenobiotic metabolism. These models range from simple enzyme preparations ( e.g., liver S9 and subcellular fractions ; Supersomes ) up to whole cell systems such as primary cultured hepatocytes ( CHs ), stem-cell derived hepatocytes, liver slices, and transformed cell lines ( Godoy et al., 2013 ; Gomez-Lechon et al., 2010 ; Guguen-Guillouzo et al., 2010 ; Ioannides, 2013 ; Vinken et al., 2014 ). In human medicine, primary CHs are generally considered as the benchmark in the field of liver-based in vitro modeling ( Benet et al., 2015 [MASK_NOLOSS], 2013 ;\",\n",

In human medicine, primary CHs are generally considered as the benchmark in the field of liver-based in vitro modeling ( Benet et al., 2015 [MASK_NOLOSS], 2013 ; Gomez-Lechon et al., 2010 ). They retain active uptake and excretion mechanisms as well as biotransformation capacity to a level comparable to the liver's hepatocytes ( Jigorel et al., 2005 ). However, the fact that CHs are kept in an artificial environment differing from that of the liver might result in relevant phenotypic changes. Thus, it was argued that the DMEs activities in CHs may significantly differ from those measured in vivo, and this would throw uncertainty on the value and relevance of the in vitro data ( Hewitt et al., 2007 ). Moreover, CHs'long-term cultivation results in a dynamic loss of the hepatocyte phenotype both at the morphological and the functional level ; therefore, they can only be used for short-term purposes ( Vinken and Rogiers, 2015 ). Hepatoma cell lines such as the human HepG2 offer some advantages in this respect, such as high availability, easy handling, nearly unlimited lifespan, and stable phenotype that does not depend on the donor characteristics ( Donato et [MASK_NOLOSS] of DMEs and DTs in these established cell lines is poor compared to primary CHs ( Benet et al., 2015 ; Gmez-Lechn et al., 2017 ; Guo et al., 2011 ; Hilgendorf et al., 2007 ). Besides HepG2, the human hepatoma cell line HepaRG is currently also being used for studies concerning xenobiotic hepatoxicity, as well as DMEs/DTs expression regulation and functionality ( Andersson et al., 2012 ; Gmez-Lechn et al., 2017 ). Further, two non-hepatic in vitro models, namely the Chinese hamster lung fibroblast ( V79 ) and the Madin-Darby canine kidney ( MDCKII ) cell lines, are commonly used\",\n",

To date, there is little information available on the whole-transcriptome profile of bovine primary CHs. Therefore, the objectives of this study were : ( 1 ) to characterize the transcriptomic profile ( basal transcript abundance ) of cattle CHs and compare it with that of the bovine liver tissue, and ( 2 ) to characterize the global gene expression of MDBK cells - to determine whether this cell line can be a complementary in vitro model to cattle primary CHs. # Materials and methods # Primary cultured hepatocytes [MASK_NOLOSS] bovine CHs were isolated from the liver caudate lobe of two healthy Charolais male cattle ( 18-month-old, 450kg body weight ).

The specimens were transported to the laboratory where the hepatocytes were isolated following the method of Van't Klooster et al. ( 1992 ), with few modifications ( Giantin et al., 2012 ). Isolated hepatocytes were washed three times with William's E medium ( WEm ), and the final pellet was weighed to estimate the appropriate amount of culture medium to be added ( 6mL of medium per each 1g of hepatocytes ).

       " '[YEAR:2017] reduction of the reaction flux boundaries. FBA was performed after the flux boundary reductions were introduced and the results were compared with the results of the reference analysis ( see Section 7.1 ). # Cells can compensate the removal of non-essential amino acids with the increased glucose uptake and increased activity of amino acid biosynthesis reactions ( see Section 7.2 ). We conducted the perturbations of amino acid uptake reactions together with the glucose uptake reaction. We performed three different analyses, i.e. with unperturbed, with 10- and with 100-fold reduction of glucosis uptake.

When glucose was decreased by 10-fold, cell growth was still comparable to the unperturbed growth. In this scenario only glutamine and tyrosine showed to noticeably influence the cell growth ( see middle Fig. 6 ), which coincides with the literature data 87.

       " '[YEAR:2017]# Introduction # The adult peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) retains significant regenerative potential, enabling the repair of even severe injuries such as full transection of the nerve trunk ( Chen et al., 2007 ). Following a lesion to the nerve, the portion of the axons distal to the injury site degenerates. However, unlike central nervous system axons, damaged peripheral axons are able to regrow and reinnervate their targets ( Chen et al., 2007 ). This process is underpinned by the remarkable plasticity of the PNS glia, the Schwann cells ( SCs ) ( Jessen et al., 2015 ; Kim et al., 2013a ). In intact nerves, SCs are present in two differentiated states, either myelinating large-caliber axons ( myelinating SCs ) or ensheathing groups of small-caliber axons in Remak bundles ( nonmyelinating SCs ). In contrast, following injury, differentiated SCs reprogram to a progenitor-like cell. Dedifferentiated SCs switch off the myelination program and acquire an array of new phenotypes, which coordinately support nerve repair. These phenotypes include 1 ) secretion of neurotrophic factors to promote axonal [MASK_NOLOSS] of axonal guidance and adhesive cues to generate a favorable environment for axonal regrowth, 3 ) initiation of an inflammatory response to promote wound healing, and 4 ) proliferation to replace lost cells ( Jessen et al., 2015 ). # Furthermore, upon transection injuries that generate a gap in the nerve, dedifferentiated SCs guide regrowing axons through the nerve bridge, a piece of connective tissue that forms across the gap to rejoin the severed stumps ( McDonald et al., 2006 ). SCs from both stumps invade the bridge as multicellular cords and migrate directionally, eventually rejoining. This generates continuous cellular conduits across the wound and along which axons regrow to cross the gap and reinnervate the distal stump ( Jessen et al., 2015 ; Parrinello et al., 2010 ). # At the molecular level, cord migration is driven by Eph/ephrin-mediated interactions between SCs and wound fibroblasts. Activation of EphB2 receptors on the SCs by ephrin-B ligands on fibroblasts induces SC sorting into cords through the relocalization of N-cadherin to cell-cell contacts in a Sox2-dependent [MASK_NOLOSS] Seminal work over the past few decades has uncovered key transcription factors ( e.g., c-',\n",

Activation of EphB2 receptors on the SCs by ephrin-B ligands on fibroblasts induces SC sorting into cords through the relocalization of N-cadherin to cell-cell contacts in a Sox2-dependent [MASK_NOLOSS] Seminal work over the past few decades has uncovered key transcription factors ( e.g., c-jun, sox2 ), epigenetic changes, and signaling pathways ( e.g., ERK, Notch ) that control SC reprogramming ( Arthur-Farraj et al., 2012 ; Hung et al., 2015 ; Jessen et al., 2015 ; Le et al., 2005 ; Napoli et al., 2012 ; Woodhoo et al., 2009 ). However, a comprehensive molecular characterization of myelinating and dedifferentiated SCs in vivo is still lacking. Furthermore, despite the specialized function of bridge SCs, it remains unclear whether the reprogrammed state is homogeneous throughout the injured nerve or whether regional differences in SC state may exist, particularly within the bridge. # This gap in our knowledge is largely due to the technical limitations of purifying sufficient numbers of SCs for standard downstream molecular analysis. Consistent with this, previous investigation of the transcriptional changes associated with nerve regeneration have been limited to analysis of whole nerves before and after injury ( Arthur-Farraj et al., 2012 ; Jiang et [MASK_NOLOSS] Le et al., 2005 ). However, interpretation of this type of analysis is confounded by the cellular heterogeneity of nerve tissue, the pronounced inflammatory response that ensues injury, and the difference in SC content between intact and injured nerves ( Cattin et al., 2015 ; Jessen et al., 2015 ). Furthermore, whole-tissue approaches are not amenable to the analysis of bridge SCs due to the extensive influx of stromal and inflammatory cells into the nerve bridge. Nonetheless, deciphering the SC transcriptome and its modulation by the microenvironment is a prerequisite to the understanding of PNS regeneration and, more generally, of the molecular basis of somatic cell plasticity. # In this study, we developed a fluorescence-activated cell sorting ( FACS ) -based approach to prospectively purify SCs from mouse sciatic nerves.

Nonetheless, deciphering the SC transcriptome and its modulation by the microenvironment is a prerequisite to the understanding of PNS regeneration and, more generally, of the molecular basis of somatic cell plasticity. # In this study, we developed a fluorescence-activated cell sorting ( FACS ) -based approach to prospectively purify SCs from mouse sciatic nerves. By combining this approach with RNA amplification protocols, we carried out transcriptional profiling of in vivo SCs from intact nerves and from bridge and distal stumps of transected nerves. Our analysis reveals novel phenotypes associated with SC reprogramming. Importantly, we also [MASK_NOLOSS] SCs of increased mesenchymal character. We show that a localized increase in TGF signaling in the bridge underlies this change in order to promote SC invasion into the wound. Surprisingly, our studies also reveal an unprecedented crosstalk between TGF and EphB2, which we find is effected by transcriptional regulation of N-cadherin downstream of TGF. # Together, our findings indicate that extracellular cues from the wound microenvironment intersect with cell-intrinsic dedifferentiation mechanisms to reprogram the SC to an invasive, mesenchymal-like cell. They further identify TGF as a key mediator of peripheral nerve regeneration after transection and Eph/ephrin signaling as a novel TGF effector, with important implications for the EMT, wound healing, and cancer. # Results # Purification of Differentiated and Progenitor-like SCs # To isolate SCs from nerve tissue, we generated Schwann-cell-specific tdTomato reporter mice ( hereafter tdTomSC ) by crossing P0A-Cre animals, which express Cre recombinase under the control of the neural crest-specific Myelin Protein Zero ( Mpz ) promoter, to Rosa26tdTomato reporter strains ( Giovannini et al., 2000 ; Madisen et al., 2010 [MASK_NOLOSS] mice revealed strong tdTomato expression, unaffected by injury, in adult sciatic nerves ( Figures 1A and S1A ). Furthermore, coimmunostaining for the SC markers MBP and p75NGFR, which specifically label myelinating and nonmyelinating SCs, respectively, confirmed that tdTomato recombination was efficient and restricted to SCs ( Giovannini et al., 2000 ; Zheng et',\n",
       " '[YEAR:2017] differential expression analysis indicated that a relatively small proportion [MASK_NOLOSS] 1,115 with &gt;2.5-fold change ). This entailed similar numbers of up- and downregulated genes that included well-established markers for both populations, further corroborating the validity of our method ( Figure 1C ). Gene ontology ( GO ) and gene set enrichment analysis ( GSEA ) revealed several distinct biological features between differentiated and progenitor-like SCs. As expected, the transcriptome of dSCs was enriched for genes involved in cell cycle, immune recruitment, and phagocytosis, whereas GO terms associated with myelination and nerve conduction were significantly downregulated ( Chen et al., 2007 ; Jessen et al., 2015 ) ( Figure 1D ). Moreover, our analysis revealed a switch in how SCs communicate with the surrounding nerve tissue, in that iSCs showed increased levels of cell-cell communication genes ( cell junction ), whereas dSCs favored expression of genes mediating communication with the extracellular matrix ( extracellular signal and extracellular matrix ). Notably, signatures of **25;25907;TOOLONG transition ( EMT ) and activated Myc were among the most highly enriched GSEA gene sets in dSCs ( Figure 1E ) [MASK_NOLOSS] cell dedifferentiation to cancer stem cells and somatic cell reprogramming to induced pluripotent cells ( iPS ) ( Ye and Weinberg, 2015 ). The transcription factor Myc is a crucial regulator of ES pluripotency and one of the original Yamanaka reprogramming factors ( Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2016 ). Therefore, these signatures support the notion that dedifferentiation is a reprogramming event that converts SCs to progenitor-like cells ( Arthur-Farraj et al., 2012 ). To investigate this further, we analyzed expression of the three transcriptional programs that define ES cell pluripotency ( Kim et al., 2010 ). These comprise targets of core pluripotency factors ( i.e., Sox2, Nanog, Oct4, Core module ), polycomb-related factors, which repress lineage-specific genes ( PRC module ), and Myc target genes ( Myc module ). Publicly available RNA-seq datasets of ES cells and differentiated CNS cells ( astrocytes and neurons ) served as reference transcriptomes ( Marks et al., 2012 ; Zhang et al., 2014 ) ( Figure 1F ). Remarkably, we found that dSCs [MASK_NOLOSS], a behavior reminiscent of ES cells ( Kim et al., 2010 ). In contrast, module activity patterns of',\n",
       " '[YEAR:2017] particularly good candidate for this because it is a master regulator of the EMT and wound healing and has been previously linked to PNS regeneration ( D &rsquo; Antonio et al., 2006 ; Lamouille et al., 2014 ; reviewed in Mirsky et al., 2008 ). We therefore examined TGF activity in the regenerating nerve using two approaches. First, we coimmunostained wild-type nerves 6 days after cut for phosphorylated Smad3 ( p-Smad3 ), the canonical downstream effector of the TGF pathway ( Shi and Massagu&eacute;, 2003 ), and also S100, which labels all SCs in the injured nerve ( Figure [MASK_NOLOSS] levels upon injury, p-smad3+/S100+ cells could be detected throughout the cut nerve, but their number strongly increased in the bridge, indicating that TGF signaling activity is maximal in bSCs ( Figures 3A and 3B ) ( Mirsky et al., 2008 ). Similar results were obtained in tdTomSC nerves ( Figure S3A ). Second, we interrogated the in vivo SC transcriptome for signatures of active TGF signaling. To generate Schwann-cell-specific TGF signatures, we performed RNA-seq of in vitro rat SCs that were cultured in the presence or absence of recombinant TGF for 16 hr. Transcripts differentially expressed in response to TGF treatment were used as signature gene sets for GSEA analysis of the in vivo datasets ( Table S5 ). As shown in Figure 3C, we found that the Schwann-cell-specific TGF signatures were enriched significantly in bSCs, but not in iSCs or dSCs. To further assess TGF activity throughout the formation and invasion of bSC cords, we next examined TGF signature genes in the RNA-seq time course data. We found that TGF target gene expression [MASK_NOLOSS] points, confirming that TGF signaling is highest in invading bSCs within regenerating cut nerves ( Figure 3D ). Consistent with these findings, TGF mRNA levels were highly enriched in the bridge microenvironment ; this was judged by qRT-PCR analysis of acutely FACS-sorted tdTomato &minus; bridge cells compared to tdTomato+ SCs ( Figure S3B ). Furthermore, the bridge contained large numbers of p-Smad3+/S100 &minus; cells-many of which were fibroblasts and endothelial cells, the most abundant cell types in this region-and fibroblasts expressed higher levels of TGF than SCs in vitro ( Figures S3C-S3E ) (',\n",
       " '[YEAR:2017] of TGF for 16 hr, and clustering was scored following immunostaining for S100. Surprisingly, we found that TGF induced mild clustering on its own and significantly enhanced cell sorting in response to ephrin-B2, leading to larger and more compact clusters ( Figures 5A and 5B ). Furthermore, we examined the effects of loss of TGF activity on ephrin-B2-induced cell sorting in rat SCs cultured in the presence or absence of TGFR inhibitors and in freshly isolated Tgfbr2 &minus; / &minus; and Tgfbr2fl/fl mouse cells. In both experiments, cell sorting was impaired ( Figures 5C and 5D ), indicating that EphB2 is strictly dependent on TGF signaling for function. These effects were mediated by Smad-dependent transcription downstream of TGFR because siRNA to the Co-Smad Smad4, which is required for nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of p-Smads and which specifically inactivated TGF signaling in our system ( Figure S5A ), also severely disrupted SC clustering in response to ephrin-B2 [MASK_NOLOSS], 2003 ). Efficiency and specificity of the knockdown were confirmed by western blot analysis and parallel cell-sorting experiments, respectively, using a second independent siRNA oligo ( Figures S5B, S5C, 6B, and 6I ). Thus, TGF potentiates EphB2-dependent cell sorting, and its absence abolishes EphB2 function. # N-Cadherin Mediates TGF/Eph Crosstalk # We next determined the mechanisms by which TGF modulates the EphB2 pathway. On activation by ephrin-B ligands, EphB2 becomes phosphorylated ( p-EphB2 ) and induces cell sorting by post-translationally modifying and stabilizing the pluripotency factor Sox2, which, in turn, increases Schwann cell-cell adhesion via relocalization of N-cadherin to cell-cell contacts ( Parrinello et al., 2010 ). We therefore asked whether TGF directly modulates any of these pathway components. Western blot analysis indicated that EphB2 phosphorylation was largely unaffected by either TGF treatment or Smad4 knockdown ( Figures 6A-6C ). Of note, a small increase in phosphorylation levels was detected in TGF samples. However, it was not accompanied by EphB2 internalization, a hallmark of activation, [MASK_NOLOSS] 6A and 6B ). Similarly, whereas ephrin-B2 stimulation increased Sox2 levels as expected ( Par',\n",

Similarly, whereas ephrin-B2 stimulation increased Sox2 levels as expected ( Parrinello et al., 2010 ), TGF treatment did not ( Figure S6 ). In contrast, analysis of N-cadherin in cell-sorting assays revealed marked regulation by TGF. TGF alone relocalized N-cadherin to Schwann cell-cell contacts to a similar extent as ephrin-B2 ligands alone, and the two ligands combined synergised to potentiate this effect ( Figures 6D and 6E ). Conversely, treatment with TGFR inhibitors or Smad4 knockdown abrogated the ability of ephrin-B2 to redistribute N-cadherin ( Figures 6F and 6G ). This was paralleled by changes in N-cadherin protein levels ; TGF increased N-cadherin levels, whereas Smad4 knockdown and inhibitor treatment strongly reduced basal N-cadherin levels, depleting both soluble and actin-bound N-cadherin pools ( Figures 6H and 6I ). # N-cadherin is a key EMT gene and a well-established TGF target ( Yang et al., 2015 ). To test whether TGF may regulate Cdh2, the N-cadherin encoding gene, at the transcriptional level, we performed qRT-PCR analysis. We [MASK_NOLOSS] with ephrin-B2 on its own, as expected, exposure to TGF alone or with ephrin-B2 significantly increased Cdh2 expression. Inhibition of TGF signaling had the opposite effect, reducing Cdh2 mRNA levels by about 50% ( Figures 6J-6L ) ( Parrinello et al., 2010 ). # To functionally assess whether transcriptional regulation of N-cadherin mediates the TGF/EphB2 crosstalk, we carried out gain- and loss-of-function cell sorting experiments. First, we knocked down Cdh2 using a concentration of siRNA oligos sufficient to block its increase in response to TGF but insufficient to significantly alter Cdh2 basal levels',\n",
       " '[YEAR:2017] loss on SC cords in the bridge. We found a decrease in the number of SCs in cords and an increase in single cells indicative of impaired EphB2-mediated cell sorting ( Figures 7D and 7E ). Then we analyzed N-cadherin expression in vivo. Consistent with a bridge-specific function, N-cadherin levels were 1.96-fold higher in bSCs than in dSCs in our RNA-seq dataset ( Figure 7F ). In addition, qRT-PCR analysis indicated that, although variable due to the low RNA input and the variable recombination efficiency seen in the Tgfbr2SC mice, Cdh2 levels trended toward [MASK_NOLOSS] remained unchanged in dSCs ( Figure 7G ). At the protein level, immunofluorescence analysis indicated that whereas N-cadherin was highly enriched at Schwann cell-cell contacts in the bridges of control nerves, the protein appeared mislocalized and more diffuse in Tgfbr2SC nerves ( Figure 7H ). This difference was not due to axonal Cdh2 expression ; colocalization of neurofilament and N-cadherin proteins was minimal, and similar numbers of axonal fibers were seen in both genotypes ( Figure S7C ). Together, these observations confirm that N-cadherin is a TGF effector within regenerating nerves in vivo. # Discussion # Since the groundbreaking discovery that differentiated somatic cells can be induced to become pluripotent by overexpression of defined transcription factors, the molecular basis of experimental reprogramming has been the focus of intense investigation ( Merrell and Stanger, 2016 ; Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2016 ). However, increasing evidence suggests that, at least in some adult mammalian tissues, reprogramming can also occur naturally in response to injury ( Merrell and Stanger, 2016 ). One of the most striking examples of [MASK_NOLOSS] peripheral nerve regeneration ( Jessen et al., 2015 ; Kim et al., 2013a ). # Here we developed a method to isolate pure populations of differentiated and dedifferentiated SCs from their in vivo nerve microenvironment, enabling us to define the molecular profile of both states. This revealed several new features of SC reprogramming, including the acquisition of mesenchymal traits. The EMT has emerged as a hallmark of cell fate conversion in development, tumorigenesis and somatic cell reprogramming ( Ye and Weinberg, 2015 ). Our work indicates that natural reprogramming is also accompanied by passage through an EMT-like transition. This finding is further underscored by a recent study on leprosy ( Masaki et al.,',\n",
       " '[YEAR:2017] injury induces neurofibroma formation selectively at the wound site in a mouse model of neurofibromatosis type 1 ( Ribeiro et al., 2013 ). # We identified TGF as an important mediator of the bSC phenotype. Although TGF signaling has been previously linked to the regulation of SC proliferation, apoptosis, and myelination, its role in nerve regeneration had not been previously assessed ( D &rsquo; Antonio et al., 2006 ; reviewed in Mirsky et al., 2008 ; Parkinson et al., 2001 ). We showed that TGF signaling is strongly increased across many cell types within the bridge and exploited our conditional, SC-specific Tgfbr2 knockout model to selectively study its role in bSCs. [MASK_NOLOSS] functions in PNS repair that are specific to bridge SCs : it reprograms bSCs to an invasive, mesenchymal-like cell type to drive invasion into the wound, and it concomitantly enhances EphB2-mediated cell sorting to promote directional collective migration. Together, these phenotypes drive repair through the hostile bridge microenvironment to enable peripheral nerve regeneration. # However, consistent with a previous study, TGF signaling was dispensable for bSC proliferation, indicating that signals other than TGF are responsible ( D &rsquo; Antonio et al., 2006 ). Our data suggest that TGF is also not a key regulator of the increased Myc activity detected in the bridge. Indeed, although TGF increased Myc expression in vitro, the overlap in differentially expressed Myc target genes between TGF-treated SC and bSCs-specific genes was minimal ( Tables S2 and S5 ). It will be important to identify the signals that drive proliferation and Myc within the wound in the future. # Whereas the ability of TGF to induce a mesenchymal transition is well established, a crosstalk with Eph signaling has never been [MASK_NOLOSS], TGF not only enhanced cell sorting downstream of EphB2 but was also necessary for EphB2 function. The crosstalk was mediated by the EphB2 effector N-cadherin, which we show is also a TGF target. Overall, our mechanistic studies suggest a model whereby TGF enhances Eph effects by maintaining high N-cadherin protein levels within bSCs. Upon activation by wound fibroblasts, Eph signaling relocalizes N-cadherin to cell-cell contacts, leading to robust SC sorting and directional migration. In contrast, in the absence of TGF signaling, N-cadherin expression decreases to levels that are insufficient for Eph-mediated cell sorting, resulting in disorganized migration of the SCs and their accompanying axons. # In summary, our findings indicate',\n",

Following injury, neuronal degeneration relieves prodifferentiative axonal signals, thereby triggering SC dedifferentiation through activation of cell-intrinsic transcriptional programs. Extrinsic signals from the microenvironment then superimpose on these programs in a context-dependent manner to adapt SC function to the specific repair requirements of their surrounding tissue. # [MASK_NOLOSS] Resource Sharing # Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the Lead Contact, Dr Simona Parrinello ( **31;25934;TOOLONG ). # Experimental Model and Subject Details # Animals # Mice were bred and maintained in the animal care facility at Hammersmith Hospital.

       " '[YEAR:2017]# Introduction # Cellular metabolism is closely coupled to differentiation gene programs in many developmental systems ( Pearce et al., 2013 ; Ryall et al., 2015 ). In part, this is due to a similar complement of transcription factors playing dual roles regulating both the gene expression programs associated with differentiation and specific metabolic pathways ( Oestreich et al., 2014 ; Polo et al., 2012 ). In T cells, T-cell-receptor ( TCR ) - and interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) -sensitive transcription factors coordinate the programming of metabolic states with the effector and memory gene programs ( Chisolm and Weinmann, 2015 ). In particular, the induction of glycolysis, glutaminolysis, and the lipid biosynthesis pathway are required for effector T cell differentiation ( Pearce et al., 2013 ; Wang et al., 2011 ). Inhibition of these metabolic states, whether in dysregulated environmental states, through genetic means, or with metabolic inhibitors, results in altered effector T cell differentiation ( Chang et al., 2015 ; Doedens et al., 2013 ; Ho et al., 2015 ; Sukumar et al., 2013 [MASK_NOLOSS] states actively contribute to the regulation of T cell differentiation gene programs are unclear. # Research in embryonic stem ( ES ) cells has provided insight into how metabolism influences epigenetic states and differentiation gene programs. Metabolic reprogramming in ES cells plays a role in broadly regulating epigenetic states through the ability of metabolites to serve as donors and substrates for DNA and histone modifications, as well as co-factors for epigenetic-modifying complexes ( Ryall et al., 2015 ). For example, threonine metabolism influences ES cell differentiation in part by modulating the metabolites S-adenosylmethionine ( SAM ) and acetyl-coenzyme A ( acetyl-CoA ) to broadly influence the state of histone modifications in the cell ( Shyh-Chang et al., 2013 ). Glucose metabolism mediated through the glycolysis pathway can change acetyl-CoA levels and bulk histone acetylation to impact ES cell differentiation potential ( Moussaieff et al., 2015 ). Recently, this activity was observed in T cells, as well ( Peng et al., 2016 ). Another example is related to glutamine ( Gln ) uptake, which in part [MASK_NOLOSS] al., 2015 ). The accumulation of intracellular KG influences the differentiation potential of ES cells, with some of its activity related to the role for KG as a required co-factor for the J',\n",

Among them, drug delivery systems, especially the nanoparticulate ones, have gained much interest due to the fibroin excellent properties of biocompatibility, biodegradability, non-toxic and preparation flexibility 3. Numerous [MASK_NOLOSS] in different therapeutic treatments, such as post-implant infection 5, colitis 6, diabetes 7 and cancer 8-10. # Generally, fibroin has 2 primary crystalline structures based on their conformation : silk I and silk II. Silk I, found in the silkworm gland, possesses mainly amorphous characteristics with a dominant number of random coils and alpha-helices. On the other hand, silk II, found in the fibers, is mainly crystalline with mostly anti-parallel beta-sheet components 11. Since most of the nanoparticle preparation techniques utilize the conformational change from silk I to silk II, the crystalline fractions could play a key role on the FNPs properties. Obviously, it significantly affects nanoparticle characteristics such as particles size, drug loading, enzymatic stability and drug dissolution profiles 12-18. For example, a reduction in the silk II content leads to an increase in fibroin proteolytic degradation 13, 14. Thus, silk II is more stable in physiological condition than silk I. Moreover, the higher the crystalline content of fibroin, the slower the release rate',\n",

Various oxidation products, including advanced glycation end products such as carboxymethyllysine and reactive aldehydes such as carboxyethylpyrrole, malondialdehyde, and 4-HNE, have been shown to accumulate in the retina and cause damage to the retina during the progression of degeneration, as observed during AMD 36-38 ; thus, all the phenotypes and pathologies of the RPE observed in vivo can not be recapitulated by the application of any single agent to a culture system in vitro. However, we were able to demonstrate the compensatory role of our in vitro culture system, which reflects proteomics data from dry AMD patients, in the present [MASK_NOLOSS] cell types that produces and secretes proteins onto at basolateral and apical surface, meeting differential demands on either side of the photoreceptors and choriocapillaris and holding a large majority of secreted proteins on the basolateral side 14, 15. In the RPE cultures exposed to oxidative stress in the present study, however, the ratios of secreted proteins between chambers corresponding to the basal and apical surfaces were reversed ; the total protein concentrations in the conditioned media from the apical and basal chambers in the in vitro culture model exposed to oxidative stress were different ( apical&gt;basal ) from those in the control cultures ( basal&gt;apical ). Likewise, each AH sample ( control, drusen, and RPD ) exhibited a different total protein concentration ( RPD &gt; drusen&gt;control ). Epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) is a complicated phenomenon through which polarized epithelial cells lose their polarity and cell-cell adhesions and acquire the mesenchymal characteristics of motility and invasiveness 39, 40. Thus, it is plausible that a dysfunctional or stressed RPE cell may lose its polarity and increasingly misdirectionally secrete [MASK_NOLOSS] surface, resulting in accumulation in the subretinal space ( forming RPD ) rather than in the sub-RPE space. We speculate that different locations or subtypes of material deposition are associated with different statuses of the RPE, especially the maintenance of proper polarity.

The section takes up these questions by bringing together approaches in feminist Science Technology Studies ( STS ) and feminist new materialisms with perspectives from critical media studies. The articles gathered here offer in-depth analyses of the dynamic entanglement of matter, technology, and meaning-making practices taking shape within and around imaging modalities, such as ultrasound, embryo imaging, sonar, computer tomography, functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography. # The assembled articles emphasize the question of how the dynamic and processual qualities of phenomena are captured and recorded and what the implications of such capturing and recording practices are for the relations between the subjects and objects of research. Focusing on the nexus of change and development of living matter and the capturing of the movement and flux of such matter in sequences of images throws questions of animation and liveliness into sharp relief. Feminist engagement with moving image techniques employed in the [MASK_NOLOSS] a static notion of life. # Live-cell imaging, in particular, came into focus as a method that makes palpable the processual qualities of cellular life by foregrounding the interactive and dynamic processes happening within cells. Live-cell images present life as animate and suggest a conception of cellular life as relational and process-oriented ( Landecker, 2012 ; Myers, 2006 ; Myers &amp; Dumit, 2011 ; for a position that challenges this claim, see Wellmann, 2017 ). However, by stressing the functional and emergent qualities of cellular life, scientific discourse on live-cell imaging risks tacitly re inscribing a mechanical model of life and glossing over the labor involved in the making of scientific images ( Myers, 2015 ). Therefore, we need to attend to the manifold steps required to produce a sequence of images in both the wet and dry lab, the politico-economic conditions under which these images come into being, the ways they circulate and are employed, as well as the political projects into which they are enlisted. # In medical and [MASK_NOLOSS] describe particular procedures, modalities and tools for producing technical images ( see for instance Bruhn, 2015, p. 127 ). In this special section of Catalyst we would like to broaden this concept to include the productive and constructive aspects of such procedures, modalities and tools. Using the notion of imaging in a broader sense helps us to gloss various practices associated with making phenomena observable',\n",

Examining the imaging of processes is one way to attend to the processual qualities of the objects of investigation such as plasticity, movement, temporality, development and the relational dynamics of the objects under study in visualization ( ranging from brains and bodies to technologies and social formations ). As such, the first part of the chiasm ( processes of imaging ) does not just [MASK_NOLOSS] also transformed by the second. The title signals our approach that involves more than a combination of two perspectives, with one privileging an understanding of the entire processes of imaging, the other indicating a certain interest in the visualization of dynamic objects. Rather, the object in the second part of the chiasm is considered processual, no matter how pre-defined its processual qualities may seem to be. It is produced and reconfigured in the imaging process. # Situating Imaging Practices between Feminist STS and Feminist New Materialisms # This special section focuses on contextualizing the construction and deployment of scientific images within social, political and economic discourses and gauges the implications of referencing scientific visualizations to legitimate power relations in the social sphere. Combining feminist STS research on the powerful effects of images with a feminist materialist perspective opens up a space for critically assessing the discriminatory effects built into imaging technologies as well as for exploring alternative ways of enlisting scientific images in practices of resistance. # Although STS research has examined both the processes through which scientific images [MASK_NOLOSS] of social fields, the myth of \" objective authority \" of scientific images still holds ( see Burry &amp; Dumit, 2008 ). The medical field and the life sciences visualize structures and processes of the interior body down to cellular and sub-molecular levels in colorful digitalized images using imaging technologies such as ultrasound, functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, and live-cell imaging. The environmental sciences, including geography, employ imaging technologies such as sonar to screen structures of earth, rock, and water and offer fine-grained maps of phenomena ranging from the geosphere to the atmosphere.

Such astrocyte-restricted Cre activity has subsequently been confirmed by using fluorescent proteins as reporters ( Niu et al. 2013 ; Su et al. 2014a ; Torper et al. 2013 ). Notably, this Cre line also labels a very small percentage of other neural cell types, such as NG2 glia [MASK_NOLOSS] of three transcription factors is sufficient to induce new neurons in the striatum of this Cre line ( Torper et al. 2013 ). This mouse line has also been employed in several other in vivo reprogramming studies including the adult mouse brain and spinal cord ( Niu et al. 2013 ; Su et al. 2014a ; Wang et al. 2016 ). # Tamoxifen-inducible Cre-dependent lineage tracing mouse lines may be superior to constitutively active Cre lines, because the target cells in the inducible lines can be pre-labeled with a fluorescent reporter under physiological conditions, and because their fates can be followed during reprogramming. Cystatin C ( Cst3 ) is enriched in adult astrocytes throughout the brain ( Bachoo et al. 2004 ). A BAC transgenic mouse line harboring the CreER T2 fusion gene in the Cst3 locus shows tamoxifen-dependent Cre activity restricted to striatal astrocytes ( Niu et al. 2013 ). When the Rosa-tdTomato reporter is used ( Madisen et al. 2010 ), astrocyte-converted neurons can be clearly identified by tdTomato expression in whole-cell patch-clamp [MASK_NOLOSS] T2 mice, in which the CreER T2 fusion gene is under the control of a 2.2-kb hGFAP promoter ( Ganat et al. 2006 ), have been used to verify the astrocyte-restricted expression of AAV-mediated genes ( Liu et al. 2015 ). # Because NSCs might migrate from SVZ to the injury site and differentiate into astrocytes ( Benner et al. 2013 ; Faiz et al. 2015 ), one should be cautious in concluding that induced neurons arose from resident/local astrocytes. An unambiguous conclusion can be drawn by employing additional lineage tracing mouse lines ( Niu et al. 2013 ). For example, endogenous NSCs and their derivatives from the SVZ and SGZ have been genetically traced in Nes-CreER TM mice ( Benner et al. 2013 ; Kuo et al. 2006 ; Niu et al. 2013 ). Furthermore',\n",

Neuronal subtypes may be differentially lost after injury and neurodegeneration. For example, neural [MASK_NOLOSS], but Parkinson's disease ( PD ) uniquely attacks dopaminergic neurons. The current reprogramming strategies are able to generate excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory GABAergic neurons in both the adult brain and spinal cord ( Gascon et al. 2016 ; Grande et al. 2013 ; Guo et al. 2014 ; Liu et al. 2015 ; Niu et al. 2015, 2013 ; Su et al. 2014a ; Torper et al. 2015 ; Wang et al. 2016 ). Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of the induced neurons have revealed electrophysiological properties for mature neurons, including action potentials and synaptic connections. However, whether these neurons have appropriately integrated into a functional network for behavior remains unclear. Encouragingly, a recent study has shown that a combination of factors, including Ascl1, Neurod1, Lmx1a, and miR128, induces glial conversion to dopaminergic neurons ( Rivetti di Val Cervo et al. 2017 ). Such in vivo programming ameliorates certain behavioral deficits in a mouse model of PD. # Fourth, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms [MASK_NOLOSS] sequencing-based genome-wide systematic analyses have shown that key reprogramming factors, such as Ascl1 and Neurog2, act as pioneer factors to initiate and coordinate the genetic and epigenetic events that eventually lead to fate switching ( Smith et al. 2016c ; Wapinski et al. 2013 ). Pathways involved in oxidative stress and ferroptosis have also been revealed as key metabolic checkpoints during the glia-to-neuron conversion ( Gascon et al. 2016 ). A candidate approach has demonstrated Ascl1, Nr2e1, and the p53-p21 pathway to be key regulators of Sox2 -mediated reprogramming in the adult brain and spinal cord ( Islam et al. 2015 ; Niu et al. 2015 ; Wang et al. 2016 ). These research gains notwithstanding, our mechanistic knowledge of the in vivo reprogramming process is still rudimentary ; hurdles remain such as cellular heterogeneity, the asynchronous nature of the reprogramming process, and the intricate in vivo environment.

The various gene-delivery methods employed for proof-of-principle studies carry dangers. Retrovirus and lentivirus have a larger cDNA-insert packaging capacity and can efficiently transduce a variety of cell types and mediate long-term stable gene expression ( Lukashev and Zamyatnin 2016 ). Nonetheless, their genome integration ability might result in the mutagenesis of genes critical for normal cell function or tumorigenesis. The non-integrating AAV vectors are a preferred method for gene therapy ( Lukashev and Zamyatnin 2016 ). Interestingly, the AAV-mediated ectopic expression of Ascl1 alone is sufficient for the robust reprogramming of glial cells in multiple regions of the brain ( Liu et al. 2015 ), raising the potential of clinical applications. Small-molecule-based methods should also be explored. Treating animals with VPA, calcitriol, or alpha-tocotrienol greatly facilitates the in vivo reprogramming process ( Gascon et al. 2016 ; Niu et al. 2015, 2013 ; Su et al. 2014a ). Cocktails of small molecules have also been shown to be sufficient for the neuronal conversion of cultured human astrocytes ( Gao et al [MASK_NOLOSS] These exciting results suggest that future research is required in order to devise clinically relevant strategies for cell fate reprogramming in vivo. # In conclusion, recent research has made great strides in neuronal reprogramming in the mammalian brain and spinal cord. The ability to create useful neurons from abundant and ubiquitously distributed glial cells raises high hopes for regenerative therapies for patients with neural injuries or degenerative conditions.

Thereafter, plasma membranes/cell walls are formed between the nuclei, resulting in a cellularized female gametophyte that commonly consists of one egg cell, one central cell, two synergids and three antipodal cells ( Huang and Russell 1992 ; Drews and Yadegari 2002 ). In the anthers, male microspores undergo an initial asymmetric mitotic division, and the smaller generative cell migrates into the larger vegetative cell. Subsequently, the generative cell within the vegetative cell divides into two sperm cells before or after germination of the pollen tube. These indicate that female and male gametes in angiosperms exist in the gametophyte after the completion of meiosis and the progression of nuclear/cell division of the haploid cell. # The egg cell is specially [MASK_NOLOSS] for embryonic development are halted until fusion with a sperm cell. Upon fusion of the egg and sperm cells, early developmental events in the fused egg cell/zygote, including an increase in intracellular Ca2+ level, union of gamete nuclei ( karyogamy ), the restart of the cell cycle, zygotic genome activation and reorganization of intracellular polarity, sequentially progress ( reviewed in Zhao et al. 2017 ). Among these gamete fusion-triggered events, knowledge about how the cell cycle in the egg cell restarts toward zygotic division is limited, although regulation of the cell cycle from a quiescent and arrested state to an active state is the most evident conversion of cell status from egg cell to zygote. In contrast to plants, in animal eggs/oocytes, it has been reported that cell cycle arrest before fertilization is mediated via cytostatic factor, CSF ( Masui and Markert 1971 ). For example, cell cycle arrest regulated by the Mos/MEK/MAPK cascade and Emi2 calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II ( CAMKII ) in eggs/oocytes of marine invertebrates and mammals, respectively',\n",

Since fertilization occurs around 1-1.5 h after pollination in our growth chambers, egg cells were isolated from flowers approximately 30 min after pollination, and these egg cells, which are supposed to be just before gamete fusion, were subjected to mDAPI staining. The frequency histogram of fluorescence intensity from nucleus of egg cells isolated from pollinated flowers showed almost same pattern with that from egg cell isolated from flowers before flowering ( Fig. S1a, b ).

       " '[YEAR:2018]associated gene expression affects the metabolism within cells and thus their observable cellular phenotype. This paper aims to improve on the current understanding of ageing ( based on transcriptomics data alone ) by modelling how age-associated gene expression changes metabolic processes, therefore enabling the identification of metabolic age predictors, selected using machine learning techniques. # Metabolic models have proven to be valuable computational tools to study metabolism, as they allow predicting phenotypes from genotypes. By modelling most of the known biochemistry of a cell, they allow achieving a mechanistic understanding of the genotype-phenotype relationship. Coupled with tools for integration of omics data, metabolic models have been successfully exploited in a wide range of applications in health and disease, including personalised, condition- and [MASK_NOLOSS] types of omics-derived data can be used to constrain metabolic models for phenotype prediction 38. The process of linking metabolic networks to phenotypes enables a better prediction of cellular phenotype compared to predictions from gene expression alone 39. Exploiting this idea to generate a poly-omic model of ageing, we first generate individual-based genome-scale metabolic models and the associated fluxomic profiles. Specifically, we use CD4 T-cell transcriptomics data to modify a constraint-based metabolic model and achieve the predicted flux distributions ( fluxomic profiles ) for each individual in the cohort. Then, we adapt machine learning techniques in order to investigate metabolic changes linked to the chronological age of the individuals. We compare transcriptomic- and fluxomic-based clustering with chronological age and find that metabolic models are a better predictor of chronological age 40. # Our poly-omic pipeline also enables us to identify metabolic biomarkers of ageing, which are validated by recent literature, and to obtain metabolic age predictors. As a result, we build a metabolic age predictor capable of calculating the metabolic ages of individuals. Although a small number [MASK_NOLOSS] knowledge this is the first time genome-scale predictors have been identified. We conclude that moving towards a poly-omic understanding of biological ageing can help provide a more accurate prediction of biological age, therefore leading to more targeted therapies for ageing individuals in a variety of environmental and physiological conditions. # Methods # The poly-omic ageing pipeline # Our pipeline starts from a meta-analysis of CD4 T-cell data containing the gene expression levels from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the chronological ages of 499 healthy individuals in the Boston area, comprised of 294 females and 205 males 42.

As the CD4 T-cell expression data was profiled on Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST microarrays, it was first normalised using RMA ( Robust Multi-array Average ) 43. In absence of a control profile, the gene expression values were then divided by the mean value for their associated probe.

These were created using constraint based modelling of the CD4 T-cell 44 augmented with transcriptomics through GEMsplice 45, by setting individual constraints on the CD4 model ( see the following subsections on constraint-based modelling for details on how the mapping was achieved ). On the personalised models, we finally adapted a set of statistical and machine learning methods based on clustering, PCA analysis and elastic net regression to identify metabolic predictors of ageing. Our pipeline thus enabled us to progress to a poly-omic understanding of ageing in human cells ( Fig. 1 ; see also the following subsections for details on the modelling approach adopted in this manuscript ). # Fig. 1 : # Poly-omic ageing pipeline. We start with the transcriptomic data and chronological ages from the CD4 T-cells of 499 individuals. We use the chronological data and corresponding age-associated transcriptomic predictors to obtain the effect of both chronological and transcriptomic ageing on the transcriptomic layer. We then combine with the functional biological network data determined by the metabolism [MASK_NOLOSS] fluxomic profiles. Finally, we adapt machine learning techniques to show that fluxomic data clusters better with chronological age than transcriptomic data, and to identify metabolic predictors of ageing ( the poly-omic ageing map ).

Firstly, we wanted to statistically compare the silhouette values for AHC and k-means to see which method performed better at clustering the data with chronological age. Secondly, we wanted to statistically compare whether transcriptomic-based or fluxomic-based clusters of individuals were consistent with chronological age. # Principal component analysis # Multidimensional data such as fluxomic datasets can be visualised using Principal Component Analysis ( PCA ). PCA can reduce multidimensional datasets to as few as two or three latent dimensions ( components ), which allows inference of variables causing the largest variations in the data. Here we use PCA to identify the fluxes accounting [MASK_NOLOSS] according to chronological age. In our PCA analysis, the fluxomic data was split according to three chronological age groups : 21 and under ( 112 individuals : 64 female and 48 male ), 22 to 49 ( 360 individuals : 219 female and 141 male ), and 50 and over ( 27 individuals : 11 female and 16 male ). The analysis was performed in R and visualised using FactoMineR 56. # The CD4 T-cell model contains 4229 flux variables ( metabolic reactions ). PCA analysis gives the contribution of each variable ( reaction ) to the variability of each component. The proportion of variability accounted for by a component is defined numerically by its eigenvalue. The total contribution T v of a given variable across the components can be calculated by determining its overall weighted sum as follows : formula omitted # where E i is the eigenvalue for the principal component i, V i is the variable ( reaction ) contribution to the principal component i, and n is the number of components chosen to represent the data [MASK_NOLOSS] a subsystem ( metabolic pathway ), which contains a number of reactions that are interlinked to perform a cellular metabolic function. The CD4 T-cell model contains 95 pathways, each of which corresponds to a number of reactions and their flux values.

Elastic net regression is a linear hybrid of the L 2 penalty of ridge regression 57 and the L 1 penalty of lasso regression 58. For alpha between 0 and 1, where [MASK_NOLOSS] and a strictly non-negative lambda, elastic net is defined as 59 : formula omitted # where formula omitted # N is the number of individuals, y i is the chronological age of individual i, x i is a p x1 vector of p metabolic pathway fluxes at individual i, alpha is set to 0.5 to achieve a balance between L 1 and L 2 norms, lambda is a positive regularization parameter, beta 0 is a scalar parameter, and beta is a p x1 vector of effect sizes on chronological age ( regression coefficients ), where p is the number of metabolic pathways. We also performed an equivalent analysis directly on reaction fluxes ( Additional file 1 ). # Elastic net overcomes some of the limitations of using the lasso method alone 59. When analysing high dimensional data, such as the individual by reaction data ( 499x4229 ), where the number of predictors is greater than the number of observations, the lasso method can only select at most the same number of variables as observations. However [MASK_NOLOSS] highly correlated, which means there is high correlation between regression predictors. Where there is a group of highly correlated predictors, the lasso method will only select one variable from the group.

Besides their plausibility, the two selected values achieved the highest accuracy in lifestyle classification by a naive Bayesian classifier ( NBC ) following a simple preprocessing stage we applied to the data. However, for this preprocessing stage, we needed results that were derived only at later stages, providing feedback to this earlier stage. First, we established a vocabulary [MASK_NOLOSS] \" of 38 people ( see Sect. 3.3 ). Second, we created n-grams of semantic sub-sequences of n POIs in the trajectories.

       " \"[YEAR:2018]# Introduction # Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with a complex etiology, and belongs to a wider class of common memory disorders ( 1 ). Previous studies have suggested that Alzheimer's disease is directly associated with hippocampal cells ( 2-4 ), and links between neural apoptosis in the corticocerebral and hippocampal regions have been observed in clinical and model studies of Alzheimer's disease ( 5,6 ). Previous studies have also indicated that the process of apoptosis serves a key role in the depletion of hippocampal cells and contributes to impairments in attention and cognitive competence through the regulation of various apoptotic factors, including B-cell lymphoma 2 ( Bcl-2 ), Bcl-2-associated death promoter, Bcl-2-associated X protein ( Bax ), amyloid precursor protein intracellular C-terminal domain, caspases, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, amyloid beta ( Abeta ), enzyme activity and reactive oxygen species production, leading to deleterious neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease ( 7,8 ). In addition, Bartolome et al ( 9 ) documented that the inhibition of neuronal apoptosis attenuated the phosphorylation of tau and protected memory function, which [MASK_NOLOSS] Alzheimer's disease. Absalon et al ( 10 ) also suggested that activation of cell cycle progression, tau phosphorylation and inhibition of apoptosis in post-mitotic neurons through microRNA regulation contributed to the recovery of mice with Alzheimer's disease. Collectively, these previous data suggest that apoptosis is associated with the complex etiology, pathogenesis and progression of Alzheimer's disease. Based on these findings, it has been suggested that targeting of hippocampal signaling pathways may be a viable therapeutic strategy in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease ( 11 ). # Apoptosis is a fundamental biological process that occurs within cells and is controlled by gene expression. Bcl-2 and Caspase-3 are two key members of the apoptotic family of proteins, and their functions in regulating the apoptosis of brain cells have been widely documented ( 12-15 ). A previous study observed that downregulation in Bcl-2 and upregulation in Bax activated P53 and Caspase-3, which lead to the induction of apoptosis in the hippocampal cells of rats ( 16 ). Bcl-2 and Caspase-3 are important molecular regulators of apoptosis [MASK_NOLOSS] the activation of caspase-3 and other pro-apoptotic factors ( 17 ). Activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) signaling pathway may mediate hippocampal apoptosis through the regulation of Bcl-2, Bax and Caspase-3. More\",\n",

This was the case irrespective of the criterion used to trigger the initiation of therapy : either a CMV DNA doubling timeprecedes/equal to2 days ( n =2 ) or a CMV DNA load&gt;1000 copies/mL ( n =15 ). It should be underlined here that the above plasma CMV DNA threshold is commonly applied for triggering the administration [MASK_NOLOSS] we identified a TTV DNA load AUC20-30 threshold ( precedes/equal to2.8 copies x days x mL-1 ) that was associated with an increased risk of high-level CMV DNAemia episodes requiring preemptive antiviral treatment in univariate models, even though it displayed a rather modest predictive value for this event.

Second, we found no correlation between TTV DNA and CMV DNA loads over the study period. Despite the above, and as previously stated, further studies are required to prove this assumption. # No reliable biological marker for identifying allo-HSCT patients at high-risk of high-level viremia is currently available other than functional CMV-specific T-cell levels in peripheral blood and this is better at predicting protection rather than the risk. 17 Early assessment of the kinetics of TTV DNA load may perhaps help to solve this unmet need in a subset of patients [MASK_NOLOSS] requiring antiviral therapy or not ), nearly 50% in this cohort, would certainly not benefit from these analyses, at least in the way they were performed here. # On the basis of the data presented here and elsewhere, 13 our current working hypothesis postulates that plasma TTV DNA load may behave as a surrogate marker of T-cell immune reconstitution ( at least that preventing high-level CMV DNAemia ) shortly after engraftment, just the',\n",

Finally, analyses of insect nutritional endosymbioses in aphids, psyllids, whiteflies and mealybugs also show similar patterns of mosaic nutritional pathways that are constructed from multiple HGT events 25, 32, 34, 51. Many of these transferred genes seem to compensate for genes that have been lost [MASK_NOLOSS] in the protist examples above -- most of those genes have been transferred from bacteria other than the existing endosymbionts. Importantly, these transferred genes come from'reproductive manipulators'such as Wolbachia spp. and Candidatus Cardinium spp., bacteria that are extremely common in insect germ cells. Thus, the transferred genes come not from the nutritional endosymbiont but from endosymbiotic bacteria with germline-cell tropism. Taken together, these results suggest that gene transfer from degenerate ( or degenerating ) extant endosymbionts to the host is not necessarily needed, or perhaps even common, and in some hosts, HGT events from other sources can compensate for gene loss in the endosymbiont 28. We argue that these data support the idea that the taxonomic diversity of HGT events in eukaryotic genomes could have resulted from previously existing HGT from non-organelle sources 44, 54, 84, 98, 99, 100, probably in combination with the'inherited chimaerism'of organelle progenitors resulting from bacteria-bacteria HGT events that predated endosymbiosis 40, 41. # A final example of a maintenance [MASK_NOLOSS].

It seems plausible that, similar to PGRPs, these enzymes could be used for symbiont protection rather than defence from pathogens, as both slime moulds and mealybugs are tightly associated with beneficial bacteria 51, 135. # Concluding remarks # Both early and recent misattributions of HGT events in animal genomes have made it clear that care is required when hypothesizing that a gene has been transferred to a genome from an unrelated organism. However, numerous papers reporting HGT events from bacteria to eukaryotes stand on solid conceptual and methodological ground ( Table 1 ). Although the field of HGT research is vibrant, there is clearly room for improvements in both the methods used to screen for contamination in [MASK_NOLOSS] events ( Box 1 ). As discussed in this Review, HGT events are used to maintain functionality -- often in situations involving an endosymbiont that is subject to genomic erosion -- but are also used to acquire new functions, such as altered nutrient acquisition and protection, and to explore new environments. To better understand the true phylogenetic and functional scope of bacterial genes in eukaryotes, a focus on phylogenetically important but neglected groups such as protists is warranted, as the majority of eukaryotic diversity resides in these understudied organisms. # Author contributions # F.H. and J.P.M. researched data for the article, made substantial contributions to discussions of the content, wrote the article and reviewed and/or edited the manuscript before submission. # Publisher's note # Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations. # Definition List : # Horizontal gene transfer : ( HGT ).

This avoids off-target effects and increases the efficiency of gene transfer. # A typical model of the state-of-the-art non-viral gene delivery system ( nVGDS ) for TRR is composed of three major elements : scaffold or matrices, cells including stem cells, and non-viral vector/gene complexes ( nVGCs ) 25.

Some of the most advanced methods for nVGD-mediated TE include the delivery of micro- or si-RNA 171-173, genetically engineered stem cell-based therapy 174-179, development of gene-activated scaffold platforms 180, 181, better spatiotemporal regulation in generating GAMs 182, 183, and more sophisticated nVGDSs 184. For future clinical applications, economic and ethical considerations as well as the ease of use should be considered. Based on these concerns, nVGDSs for TRR are faced with the following challenges. # First, the mechanism of an nVGD is still unclear. The optimal balance between transfection rate and cytotoxicity in designing novel nVVs has not yet been achieved. How to exert sufficient therapeutic effects and minimise side effects when applying an nVGDS in TRR remains a major challenge. # Second, potential seed cells, such as stem cells, have been identified for TRR. However, they are difficult to successfully transfect. In vitro culture of these cells is lengthy [MASK_NOLOSS] even more difficulties. Ethical problems are also a major concern when cells are incorporated in spite of numerous ongoing clinical trials involving stem cells. # Third, choosing proper genes or combinations of genes is a major undertaking. It is generally associated with developing a better understanding of the physio-pathological role of different genes in TRR. Some known genes have exhibited excellent effects in promoting TRR, such as gene targeting FGF2, PDGF and VEGF for angiogenesis. However, the process of TRR is sophisticated and involves various genes and other biomolecules, and better combinations of genes are expected. # Given the massive amount of scientific evidence described above, it is anticipated that significant efforts will be made to tackle the key problem of the transfection efficiency/side effects balance.

Other putative chaperone-usher pili systems and Pap pili systems, which are homologous to the P pili of Escherichia coli, have been implicated in A. baumannii biofilm formation and maintenance, yet a detailed molecular analysis describing their specific role is lacking 48, 49. # A. baumannii also produce biofilm-associated proteins ( BapAb ) 50, which are large surface-exposed proteins orthologous to the Bap protein originally characterized in Staphylococcus aureus 51. BapAb, which is secreted via a type I secretion system ( T1SS ) 52, mediates A. baumannii biofilm formation and maturation ( Fig. 1a ). Specifically, Bap has a role in cell-cell adhesion and is required for the development of higher-order structures on medically relevant materials, such as polystyrene and titanium 50. Although most sequenced strains of A. baumannii carry a [MASK_NOLOSS] bap sequences 53. It has yet to be determined if this is due to recombination events or sequence alignment errors common to the highly repetitive elements of bap coding sequences.

Finally, medically relevant Acinetobacter spp., including A. baumannii and A. nosocomialis, abundantly secrete a repeats in toxin ( RTX ) -like domain-containing protein through the T1SS 52. This family of proteins is orthologous to large repetitive RTX domain-containing proteins found in Pseudomonas putida, which mediate biofilm development 55. Other notable factors in A. baumannii that might be crucial for biofilm formation include the production of poly-beta-1,6-N -acetylglucosamine ( PNAG ) 56, which is produced by many Gram-negative species. Interestingly, antibodies against PNAG are able to eliminate A. baumannii in opsonophagocytosis assays, which suggests that PNAG might be a potential vaccine target 57.

These observations confirm that once cells have accumulated by convergent extension, the main contributor to mesoderm stiffness is cell density. # To validate the role of convergent extension in mesoderm stiffening, we specifically inhibited the planar cell polarity pathway ( PCP ) in the mesoderm with targeted injections of the PCP inhibitor DshDEP+ ( ref. 24 ). Inhibition of PCP signalling impaired neural crest migration in a non-autonomous manner, as shown by in situ hybridization and graft experiments ( Fig. 3eg and Extended Data Fig. 5hk ; fibronectin controls in Extended Data Fig. 6c, f ). In agreement with our hypothesis, cell densities and mesoderm stiffness were reduced in DshDEP + -injected embryos ( Fig. 3hk ). # To confirm that the inhibition of neural crest migration after blocking PCP is a consequence of a mechanical change in the tissue, we rescued mesodermal stiffness in the softer PCP-depleted embryos by applying sustained extrinsic compression with iAFM 12, 18, 19 ( Fig. 4a ). This was sufficient to completely rescue neural crest migration ( Fig. [MASK_NOLOSS] ( Extended Data Fig. 10 ). These results indicate that the impaired neural crest migration observed in PCP-depleted embryos was mainly due to the decreased mesodermal stiffness. # While previous in vitro studies have proposed that mechanical cues may promote EMT 10 and CCM 11, we show here that convergent extension of the mesoderm leads to local stiffening, which in turn works as a long-range signal, triggering EMT and CCM of the neural crest in vivo ( Fig. 4e ). It is well known that tissue mechanics are a key determinant in many biological processes, such as axon growth 12, central nervous system development 25 and maintenance of tissue integrity via cellcell adhesion during collective cell movement 15, 16, 27, 28. The most common regulators of tissue stiffness include ECM accumulation 21, 22, cortical contractility 13, 16, 17 and cell densities 12, 25, 26.

On the one hand, the physical isolation ('walling-off') of bacteria may reduce the rate of disease dissemination 50. On the other hand, as oxygen is a major component of antimicrobial activity, reduced access to oxygen for myeloid cells within the granuloma could be a potential disadvantage, despite these cells being in close proximity to the invading pathogen. Although granulomas were first described in 1679, true mechanistic insights into the basic biochemical signals that induce granuloma formation have only emerged in the past 15 years 51 [MASK_NOLOSS] response to a chronic stimulus ( infection or foreign body ). The cytokine TNF seems crucial in this process 52, 53. These activated macrophages are larger with more cytoplasm and intracellular organelles and a more ruffled membrane than mononuclear phagocytes in blood 50, 54. Within a granuloma, macrophages can fuse into giant cells, perhaps in response to IL-4 ( Ref. 55 ). Macrophages within the granuloma were reported to have an approximately sevenfold increase in ACE mRNA compared with kidney macrophages in a zebrafish model of Mycobacterium marinum infection, in which detailed cellular events that characterize granuloma formation can be visualized 56. Fluorescence imaging and electron microscopy showed that forming granulomas undergo macrophage reprogramming to express adherens-type cellular proteins, such as epithelial cadherin ( E-cadherin ; also known as CDH1 ), which are more typical of epithelial cells than myeloid cells, thereby allowing macrophages to form cell-cell contacts. The biochemical signals that induce the'epithelial reprogramming'described in zebrafish granuloma may also contribute to the observed increase in ACE expression. # In summary [MASK_NOLOSS] has been known for many years. However, why elevated macrophage ACE expression is such a consistent biochemical feature of a granuloma is currently unclear. One possibility is that ACE increases the antibacterial effectiveness of macrophages, as discussed below. # ACE and macrophage function. Macrophages are important in the initial innate immune response and also have a crucial role as antigen-presenting cells ( APCs ) by interacting with T cells in the adaptive response. Mice overexpressing ACE in myeloid-derived cells only, known as ACE 10/10 mice, were initially developed to study the role of angiotensin II in the development of atherosclerosis but have proved useful in advancing our understanding of how ACE overexpression can affect innate and adaptive immunity 57.

In our analysis, we identified potential regulators of the mutational processes based on the evidences of associations at both germline and [MASK_NOLOSS] and CDC27, of which the non-synonymous somatic mutations and germline genetic burden show consistent, significant effects on the activities of the mutational signatures. ZNF750 functions as a regulator of epidermal cell differentiation by promoting differentiation genes while inhibiting progenitor factors. The tumor suppressing activity of ZNF750 with significant prognostic power in multiple squamous cell carcinomas is confirmed by independent reports 38-42. As for the other gene, Cell Division Cycle 27 is an activator of cAMP-dependent phosphorylation kinase activity 43. The somatic copy-number amplification of CDC27, as an event of gain-of-function, is significantly associated with higher activity of the \" NpCpG \" signature whereas the high genetic burden in CDC27 attenuates the activity of the \" NpCpG \" signature. # The driver mutations in cancer is often confounded by outnumbered passenger mutations, which can only be distinguished by systematic functional validation. We resort to the evidences from the germline genetics to prioritize the candidate somatic driver genes, and suggested determinants of the mutational processes in ESCC. While the clinical implication of ZNF750 has been empirically proved by [MASK_NOLOSS] on the mutational processes of ESCC. The method we described can be applied to many other cancer types to suggest candidate driver genes. # On the other hand, the discovery is based on a relatively small population, which means other subtle, independent mutational signatures in ESCC are yet to be discovered. The sample size can also hinder the discovery of other novel candidate genes due to the limitation in the statistical power.

These results indicated that different pro-inflammatory cytokines have different effects on the paracrine cytokines of UCMSCs, and long-term exposure may not improve the immunomodulatory capacity of UCMSCs. We also detected Ang-1, which plays a critical role in therapeutic angiogenesis for revascularization 33, and the results did not reveal any significant difference between the control and conditioned medium groups except for the 7-day treatment with TNF-alpha. In addition, when MSCs were co-cultured with T cells, they significantly upregulated the adhesive capability of T cells due to the increased expression of CD54 and CD106 34. CD54 increased adhesion between MSCs and T cells, and inhibited T cell proliferation and other immune responses though NO pathways 34. In this study, the expression levels of CD54 were upregulated in all the treatment groups, especially in INF-gamma, TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta conditioned groups, which indicated that immunomodulatory [MASK_NOLOSS]. Moreover, CD106 also known as vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 ( VCAM-1 ) plays a critical role in cell-cell adhesion, T cell activation, and leukocyte recruitment to the inflammation site.

Hence, paracrine cytokines and surface molecules of UCMSCs, also acting as the immunomodulatory factors, present different regulation effects by different pro-inflammatory cytokines, and the stimulation time is also important for the biological changes of immune-related characteristics. # MSCs have the immunomodulatory capacity to inhibit the proliferation of various immune cells and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines 30, 36, 37. Previous studies demonstrated that MSCs could not only inhibit the proliferation of stimulated T cells, natural killer cells, and neutrophils directly, but also inhibit the generation of DCs and hamper their ability to induce the activation of the T cells 30, 37, 38.

The cyst-like follicle observed in this study may not produce estrogen due to degeneration of granulosa cells.

Using pharmacological and genetic perturbations, we found a role for phosphatases in PCM disassembly throughout mitosis, opposing CDK activity during PCM assembly and catalyzing PCM dissolution once CDK activity naturally dissipated. Cell fusion and RNAi experiments indicated that the nature of the remaining PCM was transformed and mechanically cleared from the centrosome by cortical pulling forces. Delay in PCM removal impacted subsequent centriole separation and PCM maturation in the [MASK_NOLOSS] of MTOC function at the centrosome involves a regulated two-step process of PCM disassembly, the timing of which is critical to the developing embryo. # Results # C. elegans PCM is organized into an inner and outer sphere # In order to better understand how PCM proteins behave during disassembly, we first characterized the spatial organization of the PCM during mitosis in the ABp cell of the 4-cell C. elegans embryo. ABp has relatively large centrosomes oriented during mitosis along the left-right axis of the embryo, with one of the centrosomes positioned very close to the coverslip in an end-on orientation ( Figure 1A ). We analyzed the localization of endogenously-tagged PCM proteins immediately after nuclear envelope breakdown ( NEBD ) in the ABp cell ( Figure 1A ). At this time, the centrosome still functions as an MTOC, actively growing and organizing microtubules ( Figure 1A ). # Figure caption - begin # Figure 1.

Scale bars, 5 microm. # Cortical forces mediate the disassembly of the PCM and more specifically SPD-5 # The formation of packets that appear to be pulled away from the centrioles suggests that mechanical forces underlie this aspect of PCM disassembly. Forces can be exerted on the PCM by a conserved cortically anchored complex of LIN-5/NuMA, ( GPR-1/2 ) /LGN, and ( GOA-1/GPA-16 ) /Galphai, which localizes dynein-dynactin and can pull on the astral microtubules extending from the PCM ( Kotak and Gnczy, 2013 ( 34 ) ). Given that [MASK_NOLOSS] C. elegans embryo, it has been hypothesized that these forces could be responsible for the asynchrony observed in the disassembly of the anterior vs. the posterior centrosome ( Grill et al., 2001 ( 25 ) ). Moreover, a recent study implicated the ( GPR-1/2 ) /LIN-5/DHC-1 complex in SPD-5 disassembly from the PCM ( Enos et al., 2018 ( 17 ) ). # To assess the involvement of cortical forces in the general disassembly of the PCM and specifically in rupture and packet formation, we used RNAi to either decrease ( gpr-1/2 ( RNAi ) ) or increase ( csnk-1 ( RNAi ) ) cortical forces.

In contrast, we did not observe SPD-5 rupture or packet formation in gpr-1/2 ( RNAi ) treated embryos ( Figure 4A ).

To assess the function of LET-92 on PCM disassembly in general and more specifically on dissolution and packet formation, we treated SPD-2 : : GFP ; tagRFP : : SPD-5 expressing embryos with let-92 ( RNAi ). As previously reported, let-92 inhibition caused severe defects in cell division, necessitating analysis in the one-cell zygote rather than 4-cell embryo ( Song et al., 2011 ( 66 ) ). We monitored PCM disassembly in the one-cell zygote beginning when the membrane invagination that occurs during cytokinetic furrow formation was visible. At this stage in control embryos, PCM disassembly occurs in [MASK_NOLOSS] preceding SPD-5 rupture and packet formation ( Figure 5B ). let-92 depletion impaired the disassembly of SPD-2 and SPD-5 from the centrosome in three distinct ways ( Figure 5C ). First, we never saw holes appearing in centrosomal SPD-5, indicating a defect in rupture. Moreover, SPD-5 was only partially cleared into packets, however these packets were more fluid and persisted significantly longer in the cytoplasm than control. Unlike in the 4-cell embryo, we occasionally saw a small fraction of SPD-2 being cleared from the centrosome by rupture in this first cell division, a short-lived phenomenon that was exacerbated when both SPD-2 and SPD-5 were endogenously tagged. In contrast, following let-92 depletion, SPD-2 consistently ruptured and appeared in packets that persisted in the cytoplasm long after those of control embryos. Second, the rate and time of SPD-2 and SPD-5 disassembly were significantly slower in let-92 depleted embryos than in control, as indicated by tracking the total centrosomal SPD-2 and SPD-5 over time ( Figure 5E, F ). Centriole duplication fails following let-92 depletion [MASK_NOLOSS] rather than two centrioles ( Song et al., 2011 ( 66 ) ).

       " '[YEAR:2019] of cells at the interior switches to resistant or toxin producing, the cells at the colony edge retain a sensitive phenotype. From a functional perspective, this again seems reasonable : colonies grow at their edges, and expressing a sensitive phenotype at the colony edge maximises the rate at which a colony expands into unoccupied space. Since cell density is per [MASK_NOLOSS] based on the density cue allows toxin producing and resistant cells to express the fast-replicating sensitive phenotype exactly there where the colony is growing. # Regulation allows cells to adjust their phenotype to changing growth conditions # Regulating cells can maintain a sensitive phenotype at the edge of growing colonies if their response threshold theta is larger than the cue concentration at the edge. Approximating the shape of a colony by a circle, we analytically calculated that the cue concentration at the edge of a colony is less than or equal to 0.49 ( S2 Text ). This analytical approximation corresponds well to measurements from single-colony simulations ( Fig 6A ). Although there is some variation between response threshold values of ( Reg, Reg ) -cells in the replicate runs, all values were well above this lower bound ( Fig 6B ), showing that the evolved ( Reg, Reg ) -cells indeed exploit the density cue to form fast-expanding colonies. # Fig 6. Density cue concentration profile of expanding colonies and the evolved response threshold values of ( Reg [MASK_NOLOSS] grown from a single ( Reg, Reg ) -cell to characterise the radial density cue concentration profile of an expanding colony. Measured values from the simulations correspond well to the analytical approximation ( see S2 Text ).

The evolved response threshold values vary somewhat between replicates, but are always lower than the cue concentration at local carrying capacity ( grey distributions ) and higher than the maximum of the cue concentration at the edge of a growing colony. Hence, cells on the colony edge never express their toxin production and resistance genes, while cells in the colony interior and at the interface between colonies ( where local cell density is close to carrying capacity ) are resistant and [MASK_NOLOSS] the lower bound, the evolved response threshold values are bounded from above by the cue concentrations that cells perceive at the end of a transfer cycle, i.',\n",
       " '[YEAR:2019][MASK_NOLOSS] potentially killer-specific quorum sensing, which found that QS control of toxin production was unstable to social cheating 29 ( see also the Introduction ). In this model, however, cell density was fixed, and only the local population composition ( e.g., the fraction of toxin producing bacteria ) varied over time. In the model presented here, we have seen that large fluctuations in cell density drastically change the evolution of social behaviours associated with cell density, and might favour the evolution of regulation. Studying the evolution of toxin regulation by killer-specific cues under serial transfers is therefore an interesting and promising direction for future research. # Testing whether or not bacteria employ the types of regulation we identified would require the careful monitoring of the temporal dynamics of toxin production, resistance and cell division in bacterial colonies expanding after serial transfers or growing on a plate at high density, preferably at single-cell level ( as e.g., done by Mavridou et al. 56 ). Under serial transfers, the model predicts that bacterial colonies [MASK_NOLOSS] colony, and sensitive cells on the colony of the edge. Furthermore, these sensitive cells at the edge should switch to a toxin-producing phenotype when encountering another colony. These predictions can be tested by following toxin production at the single-cell level in growing bacterial colonies of bacteria known to regulate their toxin production with a general cell-density cue. Ahead of such experiments, our modelling work has provided more insight into the mechanisms underlying the evolution of complex regulation systems in microbial populations. # Methods # The general set-up of the model is discussed in the Model section. Below, we provide details on the implementation and analysis. The model was implemented in C. Code is available from the corresponding author upon request. # Spatially structured individual-based model # We developed a spatially explicit individual-based model of bacteria evolving their production of an anticompetitor toxin, resistance, and response to a cell-density cue. Bacteria in the model are characterised by a genotype of four characteristics : a toxin production gene, a resistance gene, a toxin production rate qi [MASK_NOLOSS] ). The bacteria live on a square N x N lattice ( N = 512 for all simulations in this paper ) with periodic boundary conditions. Each lattice site can contain at most one bacterium. # Concentration profiles of the cell-density cue and the toxin # The production, degradation and diffusion of the cell-density cue and the toxin are described with partial differential equations.

       " '[YEAR:2019] if at least 10% of the cells of the regulating genotype were in the inactive phenotype ( regulated gene not expressed ), and at least 10% were in the active phenotype. Altogether, this classification assigned all simulations to one of four evolutionary outcomes : ( 1 ) Sensitives fix, [MASK_NOLOSS] 3 ) KRS-dynamics, regulation evolved, and ( 4 ) other ( S1 Fig ). # Invasion speeds # To understand why the regulating killer cells ( genotype ( Reg, On ) ) can outcompete constitutive killer cells ( genotype ( On, On ) ) under certain conditions, we compared invasion dynamics of these two killer types. To allow for a fair comparison, we first evolved constitutive killers under conditions that would usually favour regulation by removing the possibility of regulation from the model ( S3A Fig, evolved under the same parameter conditions as Fig 4 ). Over three replicate simulations, constitutive killers under these conditions evolved a mean toxin production rate of qi T = 0.13. Over the ten replicate simulations of evolving ( Reg, On ) -killers, these cells evolved a mean toxin production rate of qi T = 0.20 and a mean response threshold of theta = 0.875 ( S2 Fig ). We therefore constructed two \" average evolved killer strains \", a constitutive killer with genotype ( On, On ) [MASK_NOLOSS] with genotype ( Reg, On ), qi T = 0.20 and theta = 0.875, and compared the invasion dynamics of these two constructed killer strains. # To characterise the invasion into a sensitive population, a 20-cell-wide strip of one of the two killer strains was placed on a lattice that was otherwise filled with a sensitive population at carrying capacity ( S3B Fig ). Population dynamics were then simulated and the decline of the number of sensitives over time was followed ( S3B Fig ). The invasion speed was calculated as see PDF for formula(10) where beta S on t is the linear regression coefficient of the number of sensitive cells on time, N is the number of rows of the simulation lattice and K S = ( 1 - delta /gamma ) is the density of sensitive cells at carrying capacity. Similarly, the invasion speed of resistant cells ( genotype ( Off, On ) ) into a population of ( Reg, On ) -cells and ( On, On ) -cells was measured by placing a 20-cell-wide [MASK_NOLOSS] ( Reg, On ) -cells or ( On, On ) -cells at carrying capacity and calculating see PDF',\n",

( The invasion speeds we measure here serve as a tool to quantify the difference between the two killer strains and thus better understand the evolutionary outcome of the simulations. For a more formal analysis of the effect of toxin production and quorum sensing on invasion speeds, see 67 ). # Note that to calculate see PDF for formula the decline of the number of sensitives is used, while in the calculation of see PDF for formula the increase in the number of resistant cells is considered. This choice was made because the characteristics of the sensitive strain and the resistant strain are the same in both invasion experiments, while the two killer strains differ. [MASK_NOLOSS]. # Serial transfers # Under the serial transfer regime, simulations were again initialised with cells with random genotypes placed at a random 10% of lattice sites. Population dynamics were simulated as before, except that the simulations were periodically paused and a transfer was performed. At each transfer, a random sample of the population at the end of the growth cycle was taken as founder cells for the new population. These founder cells were then randomly placed on an otherwise empty simulation lattice, and the simulation of the population dynamics was resumed until the next transfer. Unless otherwise noted, transfers were performed every 500 simulation time steps, and each new cycle was seeded with 1, 000 founder cells. Simulations were continued for 800 ( parameter sweep ) or 1, 200 ( example runs ) transfer cycles. Evolutionary steady state was generally reached well before the end of the simulation. # Supporting information # S1 Text Parameter reduction.

This classification was performed in several steps : ( 1 ) considering the abundance of different phenotypes in the population ( sensitive / resistant / toxin producing ), ( 2 ) asking if any regulating genotype was present at appreciable abundance ( greater than or equal to 2% of the population ), and ( 3 ) asking if such a regulating genotype expressed both of its potential phenotypes ( both phenotypes expressed by [MASK_NOLOSS] final step ensures that cells identified as regulators indeed switch between phenotypes. # ( PDF ) # S2 Fig Evolution of regulation in a fixed habitat is highly reproducible.

There were no matched normal tissues for the disease samples when calling variants and instead a normal population was drawn from individuals from a distinct genetic ancestry. Additionally, the negative controls used by ReVeaL were a permutation of the positive dataset rather than a set of data of normal patients stemming from the limited number of normal samples collected in a comparable fashion and sequenced to a similar depth. Given these limitations and the performance of ReVeaL against the permuted controls, the signal identified in the non-coding and dark sector remains important. # Discriminative features in the dark sector offers potential targets for functional studies to validate their role in their respective disease etiologies.

In addition, we found that the mutational load ordering-by-disease across features was not correlated with diseases as had been found in other cancer types.

One potential therapy is based on microRNAs ( miRNAs ). # The majority of the human genome is transcribed into non-coding RNA ( ncRNA ), and only 2-3% of the genome encodes protein-genes 6. The most studied types of ncRNAs are miRNAs. MiRNAs are a class of small ncRNAs, made of approximately 22 nucleotides 7, that are involved in gene-regulation at the post-transcriptional level by inducing mRNA degradation and translational repression. Additionally, it was shown that miRNAs have [MASK_NOLOSS] up regulating protein expression, interacting with RNA binding proteins, binding to Toll-like receptors and inhibiting nuclear or mitochondrial transcripts 8. Mature miRNAs or precursor transcripts are well-known to be involved in the mechanisms of carcinogenesis 9-12 and are potential new therapeutic targets and biomarkers. # This review aims to answer the following questions regarding the role of RNA theranostics for brain tumors : ( 1 ) which miRNAs are the best candidates to become early diagnostic and prognostic circulating biomarkers? ; ( 2 ) how to deliver the therapeutic agents in the CNS to overcome the blood-brain barrier? ; ( 3 ) which are the best methods to restore/inhibit miRNAs? # Deregulation of miRNAs in brain tumors # Role of miRNA dysregulation in gliomagenesis # It is known that miRNAs play a role in the initiation and development of various types of cancer 13, 14. In the past few years, the role of miRNAs in gliomagenesis has been intensely studied.

The same study found that miR-16 could induce apoptosis by inhibiting the expression of B-cell lymphoma 2 ( BCL2 ), as previously described in chronic lymphocytic lymphoma 18, 19. BCL2 is an anti-apoptotic mitochondrial protein also involved in the early stages of glioma cells proliferation and progression to HGG 19-21.

One recent paper described that miR-184 could act as a tumor suppressor miRNA in gliomas by targeting TNF-alpha-induced protein 2 22. # The microenvironment and the immune cells # Gliomas are able to manipulate the cells from the surrounding microenvironment and promote cancerous cell migration, growth and immune evasion 23. The aggressiveness of GBM is partially caused by the inability of the immune system to detetc its growth 24. Microglia are resident macrophage of the CNS, that play a role in immune surveillance and [MASK_NOLOSS] microglia and their immune marker profile is strongly influenced by microenvironmental factors 26, 27. Microglial cells and macrophages can turn to an M1 phenotype ( or classically activated macrophages ) or an M2 phenotype ( or alternatively activated macrophages ) 28. Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ), lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ), tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) and interferon-gamma ( INF-gamma ) promote the transformation of microglial cells to M1 phenotype 28, 29. Through secretion of cytotoxic factors and presentation of tumor antigen to T helper type 1 cells ( Th1 ) cells, M1 cells display their role in antitumoral immunity. 30. Furthermore, by activation of STAT1, M1 cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and increase T-cell-mediated cytolysis 30, 31. # MiR-155, a pro-inflammatory miRNA, was directly linked to the M1 phenotype 32. Glioma cells produce IL-1 which strongly upregulates miR-155 in glial cells 33. MiR-155 is upregulated by LPS, TNF-alpha and INF-gamma and targets the anti-inflammatory protein suppressor of cytokine signalling 1 ( SOCS-1 ) 34. Thus, miR-155 leads to [MASK_NOLOSS] the inducible nitric oxide synthase, IL- 6, and TNF-alpha 34. In glioblastoma, miR-155 is an onco-miRNA that is highly expressed and its levels gradually enhance with the increase of tumor grade 35. MiR-155 knockdown enhanced',\n",

This therapeutic method is appealing because recent data show that circRNAs are abundant in the brain and function as natural sponges 83, 84. Cell lines and orthotopic glioblastoma mice models infected with miR-23b sponge expressing lentivirus had decreased angiogenic, infiltration and migration properties by downregulating MMP2, MMP9, VEGF, HIF-1alpha, beta-catenin, and ZEB1 and upregulating VHL and E-cadherin 85. Indirect inhibition of miRNAs is realized by miRNA masks. MiRNA masks bind to the miRNA binding site on the mRNA, called miRNA response element ( MRE ), and protect the mRNA from miRNA inhibition 86 leading to an up-regulation of the suppressed oncomiR targets. # Nadaradjane et al. demonstrated that miRNAs can also be used to decrease the chemoresistance of glioblastoma cells 87. By administering in glioblastoma mice models miR-370-3p and TMZ the tumor volume reduced by two-fold when compared to TMZ alone. Also, orthotopic xenografts of P-GBM2 cells with miR-198 overexpressed, [MASK_NOLOSS] tumor growth 88. Chen et al. showed that in GBM xenografts treated with miR-181b the tumor growth was suppressed and the sensitivity to TMZ was increased through the downregulation of EFGR 89. # Intravenously delivery of miR-142-3p lead to an increased survival of mice bearing GL261 tumor cells by inducing the apoptosis of M2 immunosuppressive macrophages 90. Finally, miRNA therapy can be combined with oncolytic viral treatments. Semliki Forest virus-4 ( SFV-4 ) has oncolytic properties. Systemically delivery of engineered SFV-4miRT ( containing target sequences for miR-124, miR-125 and miR-134 to reduce its neurovirulence ) increased the survival of glioma and neuroblastoma mice models 91. # When administered intravenously in murine glioma models, miR-124 led to an inhibition of glioma growth.

Also, interestingly, in vivo data showed that, the cells overexpressing these miRNAs deliver the miRNA cluster to nearby cells via EVs and subsequently promote a widespread antitumoral effect 93. # By running an in silico analysis based on differentially expressed miRNAs in GBM and their target genes, Xiong et al. identified three new potential miRNA-based agents for GBM therapy ( gefitinib, exemestane and W-13 ) 94. Using this approaches one might resolve the heterogeneity problem that arises in GBM. # MiRNAs as potential diagnostic tools # A biomarker is a biological indicator, that can be objectively measured, which reflects the risk or presence of a disease 95. The utility of biomarkers in managing brain tumors has grown in importance over the past decades, some being already used in daily medical practice, e.g. the methylation of the promoter of the gene for O6 -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase ( MGMT ). In the latest WHO classification of [MASK_NOLOSS] define the diagnosis 96. One of the extensively studied biomarkers are miRNAs, and although they are not currently used in clinical practice ; advances in this field show that their utility in the oncologic diagnostic process may be crucial, and could replace specific steps in current diagnostic practices. For example, replacing a traditional tissue biopsy with a so called \" liquid biopsy \" would spare the patient and the doctor a diagnostic surgical intervention. Also, given the heterogeneity of gliomas, using only a small tissue sample obtained from surgery or a biopsy could lead to an undergrading, like it was demonstrated for Isocitrate Dehydrogenase ( IDH ) wild-type gliomas 97. More than that, biomarkers could',\n",

In order to achieve this desiderate and confirm the potential of miRNAs a standardization of future studies is necessary : ( a ) use of similar biofluids for diagnostic ; ( b ) use of similar RNA extraction methods ; ( c ) use of similar normalization methods. Additionally, we consider that the specificity and sensitivity of diagnostic tests can be increased by using miRNA diagnostic trees or miRNA networks. # Moreover, miRNAs [MASK_NOLOSS] their wide mechanism of action, miRNAs are an ideal treatment for an extremely heterogeneous tumor type. In vivo therapy data shows that miRNAs can reactivate the immune system 69 or attenuate drug resistance 87 - two of the limitations of current therapies. One of the most important restrictions of this unmet medical need is the delivery of RNA therapeutics into the CNS, over the BBB. In recent years novel carriers were developed and synthesized which could overcome this limitation, and because of their structure and small molecular weight, miRNAs are the ideal loading of these delivery mechanisms. # Abbreviations : AMOs : Antisense oligonucleotides ; AQP11 : Aquaporin-11 ; BBB : Blood-brain barrier ; BCL2 : B-cell lymphoma 2 ; CED : Convection-enhanced delivery ; circRNAs : Circular RNAs ; CNS : Central nervous system ; CSF : Cerebrospinal fluid ; ctDNA : Circulating tumor DNA ; CVOs : Circumventricular organs ; Evs : Extracellular vesicles ; GM-CSF : Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor ; HGG : High grade gliomas ; ICH : Intracerebral hemorrhage ; IDH : Isocitrate Dehydrogenase ; INF-gamma : [MASK_NOLOSS] Low-grade gliomas ; LNA : Locked nuclei acid ; lncRNAs : Long non-coding RNAs ; LPS : Lipopolysaccharide ; MGMT : methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase ; miRNAs : microRNAs ; MRE : miRNA response element ; ncRNA : Non-coding RNA ; NPC : Neural precursor cells ; OS : Overall survival ; PCNSL : Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma ; PDPK1 : **28;30;TOOLONG protein kinase 1 ; RISC : RNA induce silencing complex ; RNP : RNA nanoparticles ; SFV-4 : Semliki Forest virus-4 ; SOCS-1 : Supp',\n",

Using transcriptomic analyses of individual cell states, we comprehensively defined the context for TH activities by identifying populations and subpopulations of adult NC derivatives. We then assessed the consequences of TH status for lineage maturation across pigment cell classes. Our analyses showed that TH drives maturation of cells committed to melanophore and xanthophore fates through different mechanisms, promoting terminal differentiation and proliferative arrest in melanophores, and carotenoid-dependent repigmentation in xanthophores. These mechanisms reflect different developmental histories of melanophores and xanthophores and yield different cell-type abundances when TH is absent.

Representing a terminal stage of pigment pattern development, we also collected mCherry+ cells from one sample within each replicate of 11 SSL ( juvenile, five fish per condition ) euthyroid and hypothyroid fish. To capture cells representing the EL pigment pattern, we collected mCherry+ cells from five dpf larvae ( 50 fish ). In each experiment, we ran parallel euthyroid and hypothyroid samples ( fish were siblings ). For each sample, we targeted 2000 -- 4000 cells for capture using the Chromium platform ( 10X Genomics ) with one lane per sample. Single-cell mRNA libraries were prepared using the single-cell 3'solution V2 kit ( 10X Genomics ). Quality control and quantification assays were performed using a Qubit fluorometer ( Thermo Fisher ) and a D1000 Screentape Assay ( Agilent ).

We assigned clusters to cell types based on the detection of published marker genes. Cells isolated from euthyroid and hypothyroid fish were combined to maintain consistency of analysis and for comparisons between groups. Batch correction methods were not used between the two groups or across samples because we did not observe sample-specific separation or [MASK_NOLOSS] UMIs were discarded as possible doublets.

The authors originally hypothesized that the imbalance in pigment cell lineages found in hypothyroid zebrafish is caused, in one model, by an amplification of one cell type at the cost of [MASK_NOLOSS], they hypothesized that thyroid hormone has discordant affects on a particular cellular behavior in both lineages. Thus, a perturbation in thyroid hormone function would result in the observed melanophore excess and xanthophore deficit seen in hypothyroid fish. In order to test these hypotheses, the authors used single-cell sequencing to profile thousands of neural crest-derived cells and reconstructed pigment cell developmental trajectories in pseudotime. A comparison of the euthyroid and hypothyroid trajectories revealed a buildup of both immature melanophores and xanthophores, which was incongruent with their first two models and caused the authors to seek another explanation. Utilizing their scRNA-Seq data, they investigated differentially expressed genes in melanophores and found that maturation genes were expressed at lower levels in hypothyroid fish when compared to euthyroid fish. Based on this transcriptional finding, the authors found that some euthyroid melanophores have greater staining for senescence markers when compared to hypothyroid melanophores. In analyzing the xanthophore lineage, the authors found that genes involved with carotenoid pigment production are differentially expressed between hypothyroid and euthyroid xanthophores. In support of this transcriptional [MASK_NOLOSS] xanthophores are still present but unable to mature. The authors combined these analyses to construct a new model in which thyroid hormone drives maturation of both adult xanthophores and melanophores, but via independent',\n",

In all micrographs, the blue signal shows the nuclear marker DAPI. Fluorescence micrographs were acquired with a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope. All images were adjusted and assembled in NIH ImageJ. # Modeling of FP production, maturation, and degradation # The model used to calculate reporter synthesis, maturation, and degradation was modified from previously described equations ( Wang et al., 2008 ( 58 ) ) with the addition of an equation for mRNA degradation. Briefly, degradation of mRNA and the synthesis rate of premature ( nonfluorescent ) protein ( NP ) is proportional to the mRNA concentration ( R ). Generation of the mature reporter ( MP ), modeled as a first-order chemical reaction [MASK_NOLOSS] degradation is modeled independently of the maturation process. The degradation rates of mRNA and proteins are first modeled based on Michaelis-Menten ( MM ) function ( Figure 1-figure supplement b, equations 1-3 ), which considers the potential saturation of the degradation machinery. When the substrate concentration is significantly smaller than the Michaelis constant Km, the equations can be simplified with the half-life of the mRNA and protein explicitly displayed ( Figure 1 -- figure supplement 1b, equations 1'-3'). Dilution by cell division is not included in this model because the fluorescent signal is analyzed in a cell cluster rather than in individual cells, and cell division does not affect the total intensity from the entire cell group and no significant changes in degradation speed have been observed between different cells ( Figure 3 -- figure supplement 1 ). With this first-order kinetic model, the transcriptional activity of the promoter F(x) can be calculated through equation from the observed fluorescent reporter signal MP ( 4 ). For sfGFP, the maturation time is 0.1 hr, [MASK_NOLOSS] that equation 4 can be further simplified as 4 '.

Advanced researches are required for certain results. # Dendritic Cell Vaccines # Primary immune response is targeted by transferring DC-cultured tumor-related antigen or tumor cell lysates to the patient. Monocyte-derived DC applications are more common. 26 # Van Poppel et al. 27 combined all studies on this subject ( 21 studies ) in a meta-analysis of 296 patients in 2009 and reported complete response in 4, partial response in 12, and clinical response in a total of 95 patients ( 37% ) including 12 patients for partial response and 79 patients for stable disease. # Laurell et al. 28 injected pro-inflammatory allogeneic DCs ( INTUVAX ) in the kidney tumor in 12 mRCC patients in intermediate- and poor-risk group twice a [MASK_NOLOSS] T cells infiltration was detected in 5 out of 12 kidney tumors extracted. No objective tumor response was observed, and 6 out of 11 assessable patients had subsequently received additional treatment with standard TKI. Three of these six patients experienced an objective tumor response including one sunitinib-treated patient responding with a complete and durable regression of four brain metastases. # Zhang et al. 29 evaluated the effectiveness of DCs pulsed with antigen derived from CD105+ human RCC cancer stem cells against renal cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. They reported that cancer stem cell-targeted DC therapy could be a potent strategy for the elimination of cancer stem cell and therefore the prevention of posttumor therapy tumor metastasis and relapse. # Amin et al. 30 randomly compared sunitinib-combined autologous DC vaccine ( AGS-003 ) treatment with just sunitinib treatment in the phase 2 study they made on 21 mRCC patients and reported that survival was significantly better in autologous DC vaccine + sunitinib group ( 57 + or - 1 months vs. 30 + or - 2 1 months ). This result inspired [MASK_NOLOSS] and should report initial results soon. # Wei et al. 31 applied DC-based vaccine and anti-CD69 antibody treatment in murine RCC and reported that anti-CD69 antibody increased antitumor efficiency of DC-based vaccine and caused significant decrease in tumor volume and significant increase in T-cell proliferation and activity. # These studies show that DC vaccines constituted antigen-specific immune response in mRCC patients and can be used safely in most patients as they provide tumor regression in most patients. # Peptide Vaccines # Synthetic',\n",

It is in limited amounts in normal tissues including kidney in 90% of RCC patients. Tumor-associated antigen and human lymphocyte antigens ( HLA ) were also defined in RCC. The first peptide vaccines were made with CA9 antigen. Studies on peptide vaccines can be separated into two groups as metastatic and adjuvant. 33 # Peptide vaccines metastatic studies # [MASK_NOLOSS] 23 progressive cytokine refractory HLA-A24+ mRCC patients. CA9-specific, CTL, and immunoglobulin G response was observed in nearly 70% of the patients. Clinical response ratio became 39%. But at least 12 vaccinations are required for CTL response due to the low immunogen effect of peptide. 34 # In the phase 1 study made on eight mRCC patients, CA9 peptide vaccine was applied and specific, and CTL and immunoglobulin G response were not observed despite five intradermal injections. 35 # In phase 1-2 study made on three mRCC patients, Wilms tumor ( WT1 ) peptide vaccine was applied and long-term stable disease was observed in two patients. CTL response was observed after a 12-week treatment. But the vaccine was detected to cause severe leukopenia in myelodysplastic syndrome patients. 36 # Patel et al. evaluated two phase 2 studies on mRCC patients together, one was a nonrandomized study on 60 patients and the second was a randomized study on 36 patients and the patients were applied heat-killed Mycobacterium Vaccae SRL172 peptide vaccine.

In the phase 2 studies made, it was demonstrated to increase survival ratio and lengthen progression time. In two phase 1 and phase 2 studies including 96 mRCC patients, a T cell response proportional to the tumor-related peptide count and better disease control were reported in phase 1 study, and better immune response and thus longer general survival were reported in phase 2 study. 41 # Rini et al. 42 compared sunitinib + IMA901 to only sunitinib treatment in metastatic or locally advanced clear-cell RCC patients in Phase 3 of IMPRINT study and detected no significant difference in overall and progression-free survival rates amongst two groups. # Kirner et al. 43 reported that T-cell response occurring with IMA901 was lower when compared to [MASK_NOLOSS] Peptide Vaccines Adjuvant Studies # Autologous HSPCC-96 ( oncophage ) # Oncophage was given to the patients in the phase 3 study made on 371 patients who have high recurrence risk after nephrectomy, and no difference was detected in progression-free survival and recurrence rates between the observation group ( 37.7% and 39.8% ). General survival data for this study are not enough. 44 mRCC studies are not completed yet. # Conclusion # In addition to their efficient potential on prolonged overall survival, decreasing tumor burden and in long- term cancer development, vaccine treatments are especially effective in mRCC patients. We think that vaccine treatments would be applied more in near future since RCC are immunogenic. But more clinical data and studies are required to support the positive aspects of vaccine treatments. # Financial support and sponsorship # Nil. # Conflicts of interest # There are no conflicts of interest. # References # 1.

       " '[YEAR:2019] contains all three motifs ( Fig. 4a ), which was well characterized by the product ion spectra ( Fig. 4b ). Significant increases in the TSP 402-460 peptide were measured dose-independently within serum at the 10 mug ( p = 0.002 ) and 40 mug ( p &lt; 0.001 ) doses, but dose-dependently in BALF at the 40 mug dose ( p = 0.002 ) relative to DM control ( Fig. 4c ). The average serum TSP 402-460 peptide concentration was then approximated at 24 nM and 20 nM in serum from 10 mug and 40 mug MWCNT-dosed animals, respectively, using the mean mass spectrometer response to a known peptide concentration. The similar concentration between the two MWCNT doses paralleled the comparable vascular deficit induced by the serum peptide fraction per myography ( Fig. 3d ). Furthermore, the increased serum amount of the 59-mer peptide at [MASK_NOLOSS] lung tissue ( Fig. 2b ). Yet known MMP9 cleavage of TSP between residues 306-307 sits well away from the TSP402-460 peptide identified here ( Fig. 4d ), suggesting additional tandem cleavage events by other proteases. TSP is well known to be proteolyzed by other matrix-related enzymes such as MMPs 2 and 14, ADAMTSs 1 and 7, and cathepsin G 53-56. Moreover, TSP is proteolyzed by immune-cell released and circulating enzymes, for example, elastases, thrombin, plasmin, and HtrA1 56-60. The complement of established cleavage sites for these proteases ( Fig. 4d ), however, are likewise nonspecific to the sequence of the TSP 402-460 peptide. Recognizing that the full complement of TSP cleavage events, particularly with sequential processing by multiple proteases, can not be known, we then looked to site prediction informatics. Using the feature-based tool PROSPER 61, we resolved that the c-terminal side of the TSP 402-460 peptide is a probable neutrophil elastase cleavage site ( cleavage probability score 1.11 &gt; 0.8 cutoff for positive prediction at an 82.9% [MASK_NOLOSS] proteolytic processing needed to yield this peptide is expectedly complex, its retained CD36 ligand characteristics exemplify the bioactive potential of the MWCNT-induced circulating peptidome. # Fig. 4 : # MWCNT-responsive thrombospondin fragment identified with CD',\n",
       " '[YEAR:2019] 33. Of particular interest to us are the mutations that inactivate O R 1 site so that repressor can not bind to it. It has been observed experimentally that this type of inactivation leads to an increased [MASK_NOLOSS] decreased affinity for O R 2 in comparison with a wild type phage lambda. This effect is due to repressor dimers occupying either O R 1 and O R 2 or O R 2 and O R 3 sites simultaneously. If the altered affinity for O R 2 is smaller than the affinity for O L 2, then such a mutant could validate our hypotheses. # Discussion # Hybrid system models, such as the one introduced by us, close the gap between Boolean networks and differential equation models. Hybrid models allow to represent the dynamics of concentration changes without requiring detailed knowledge of kinetic parameters. Several extensions of Petri Nets also incorporate both continuous concentration changes and discrete parameters, among them a Petri Net formalism with stochastic time delays 34 and Hybrid Petri Nets having two types of places and transitions, discrete and continuous 35. # A disadvantage of many hybrid system models is the lack of mathematical tools and software for their analysis. Here, we address both of these problems. We build a characteristic graph for [MASK_NOLOSS] method allows us to identify all attractors of a model. Such an analysis also provides crucial information for suggesting experiments that can distinguish between various steady states. The scalability of our approach will depend on the number of constraints for binding site affinity orderings - having more constraints can drastically reduce the size of a characteristic graph. # Process Hitting is one of the alternative techniques that can be used in modelling networks with partial knowledge of interactions between biological entities ; this framework does not require the knowledge of quantitative parameters 36. The authors propose a method for inferring positive and negative influences of other genes on the expression of a particular gene ( some influences can remain ambiguous ). They represent the more complex logical functions that govern gene expression as constellations of several components, possibly involving time delays between their activation. In contrast, we propose to model each control function as one item. They enumerate all feasible parameterisations of a biological network - the number of these is exponential in the number of regulators of a network component [MASK_NOLOSS] biological constraints. This approach is similar to our way of constraining threshold orderings. Process Hitting was used to infer 40 parameters out of 195 for an ERBB receptor-regulated G1/S transition model with 20 components 37 and 77 out of 143 for a T-cell receptor model with 40 components 38. # Process Hitting framework',\n",

The authors use linear functions with unknown gradients to model changes in concentrations between each pair of thresholds. They obtain ranges of delay parameters that allow moving to a certain successive state. From this information necessary conditions for reaching attractors can be derived. In contrast, we do not require the assumption of linearity of growth/degradation functions in our method of attractor analysis. Their framework was applied to the phage lambda network described in 7 and a model of ERBB Receptor-regulated G1/S transition involved in the breast cancer. # Our proposed modelling framework has several similarities with asynchronous automata 40. Within the latter approach logical functions determine whether a protein is synthesised or [MASK_NOLOSS] whether proteins are bound or not bound to binding sites. Their model incorporates binding thresholds for pairs of proteins and binding sites ( one threshold per pair ). All thresholds have to be linearly ordered and ambiguities within an ordering are not allowed. For each expression level of a gene, differential equations describe the growth and degradation dynamics of the protein it produces. # The authors of 40 propose to draw a graph of possible sequences of states for a gene regulatory network. A state is determined by the positions of protein concentrations relative to thresholds. They detect attractors by analysing cycles in a state graph and determining which of these cycles and under what conditions are consistently up-regulating or down-regulating. # There are some important differences between our approach and asynchronous automata. They had to create separate states that correspond to protein concentrations being equal to threshold values - we do not need such a device, because our association and dissociation thresholds are distinct for each pair of a protein and a binding site. As a consequence we do [MASK_NOLOSS] states. # The method in 40 requires that the relative protein concentration with respect to its binding thresholds coincides with the expression level of its producing gene',\n",

       " '[YEAR:2019] F ). Thus, among our cohort at least, non-monocyte sources of MCP-1 ( i.e., macrophages and dendritic cells ) are suspected to contribute to the variability between the two groups. Additionally, our data suggest that differences in monocyte function, rather than the proportion and composition, may exist between insulin-sensitive and insulin-resistant individuals. # Given the role of DNA [MASK_NOLOSS] examined the methylomic landscape of monocytes in insulin-sensitive and insulin-resistant individuals. Our comparative analyses revealed 123 DMLS whose methylation states robustly stratified insulin-resistant and insulin-sensitive individuals as illustrated by the near complete clustering ( Fig. 1b ), similar to our previous work describing DNA methylation differences in monocytes between HIV-infected individuals with and without cognitive impairment 32. Similar associations stratified insulin-resistant and insulin-sensitive individuals with DNA methylation differences in visceral adipose tissue 84. These differences occurred preferentially downstream of promoter regions, in particular within gene bodies and CpG shores ( Fig. 1c ). Notably, these regions contain the highest DNA methylation dynamics, often exhibiting tissue/cell type specificity 62. Methylation in these transcribed regions could be relevant to regulating gene expression via alternate promoter usage or alternative splicing 85. Interestingly, we observed DNA hypomethylation in the DMLs of insulin-resistant individuals ( Fig. 1d ), a finding similar to a previous report describing extensive DNA hypomethylation in pancreatic beta islet cells from patients with T2D 86. Hypomethylation may underlie variable monocyte function between insulin-resistant and insulin-sensitive individuals by impacting [MASK_NOLOSS] ontology analysis ( Table 3 ) revealed that most of the DMLs we observed that relate to insulin resistance occured at genes involved in aerobic respiration ( NDUFS7 ), growth hormone secretion ( RAB1A ), positive regulation of macrophage chemotaxis ( CMKLR1 ), and rapid glucocorticoid signaling ( MAPK11 ). Functionally, these genes have all been previously described in pathways relating to insulin resistance via signaling or inflammatory pathways 63-70. Furthermore, each of the CpGs annotated to these genes occurred in intragenic regions and exhibited DNA methylation levels that were significantly inversely correlated with insulin resistance ( Additional file 3 : Figure S3A-D ), further implicating a functional role for the methylation in monocyte activity related to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. # In addition to implicating gene pathways that may be epigenetically dysregulated in insulin resistance, we sought to explore the feasibility of DMLs from monocyte in predicting the insulin',\n",
       " '[YEAR:2019][MASK_NOLOSS] DNA methylation, particularly at dynamically regulated sites, such as in gene bodies as we observe here, is a prominant feature of differentiation wherein the chromatin landscape is vulnerable to drastic change. The chromatin landscape of hematopoietic stem cells appears to be less well defined compared to later stages of differentiation 92. During differentiation, the chromatin landscape adopts a more uniform pattern indicative of their differentiated and more restricted cell fate. However, a recent study examining individual cells in defined populations revealed remarkable diversity in the chromatin landscape of distinct cell types previously characterized on the basis of cell type-specific surface markers 92. This heterogeneity suggests that among populations of cells thought to be \" homogenous, \" there could exist multiple, previously uncharacterized subtypes, possibly with distinct functional diversity as well. Given our data showing the higher degree of variability in methylation levels of the monocyte population we described based on the expressivity of monocyte-specific cell surface markers CD14 and CD16 among insulin-resistant and insulin-sensitive individuals coupled with the observation that the methylation levels at these same sites [MASK_NOLOSS] be similar to those of HSCs, the monocytes in the insulin-resistant state could be more functionally diverse than their insulin-sensitive counterpart. This diversity in function could potentially explain the significantly higher degree of variability that the IR group exhibits in systemic inflammation and other clinical parameters ( Table 2 ). This notion is further supported by the observation that the CpGs whose methylation states in monocytes of insulin-resistant individuals that were indistinguishable from that of HSCs were overrepresented at genes involved in pathways important to HSC differentiation and pluripotency 93, 94. Consistent with these findings, increased variability in DNA methylation in immune cells ( T cells, B cells, and monocytes ) was observed among twins discordant for type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1D ), wherein higher variability was observed in the T1D twin as compared to the healthy twin 91. Furthermore, analysis of cord blood derived from newborns progressing to T1D suggests the differentially variable DNA methylation states may originate from birth, supporting our notion that dysregulation of DNA methylation underlying monocyte function may originate during differentiation. [MASK_NOLOSS] monocytes under the insulin-resistant condition may be contributing to the variability of systemic levels of inflammation underlying insulin resistance. Our data implicate the possibility of previously unrecognized monocyte subtypes developing under the insulin-resistant condition, likely due to aberrant myeloid differentiation, that could be contributing to disease progression. Future work characterizing this cell population at the single-cell level could confirm this notion, which would reveal further insights into monocyte heterogeneity and their various functions in insulin resistance.',\n",

Here, we provide the first evidence for a distinct methylomic signature in peripheral monocytes associated with insulin resistance in HIV-infected individuals. The IR-associated DMLs underlying this signature were overrepresented at genes involved in immune function. Further, these DMLs were preferentially distributed at CpG island shores and gene bodies, areas of the genome that are particularly susceptible to epigenetic regulation 62. Of note, most of these DMLs appeared to be independent [MASK_NOLOSS] of these CpGs strongly accounted for the insulin-resistant condition independent of other clinical risk factors. Together, these results suggest immunoepigenetic biomarkers in monocytes that may be predictive of insulin resistance. Further, our comparison with hematopoietic stem cells suggests that the methylation states of some of these CpGs in monocytes of IR individuals might originate from a failure to undergo normal epigenetic regulation during myeloid differentation. These sites may, for example, be protected from the dynamic changes in methylation during differentiation and consequently alter the trajectory of expression states of underlying genes that impact monocyte function in the insulin-resistant condition. Future research will need to examine whether methylation differences in insulin resistance occur prior to its onset and are functionally relevant, which collectively will lead to improved early diagnostic and treatment strategies that reduce the development of insulin resistance and related chronic conditions in populations with a heightened risk, including HIV-infected and aging populations. # Abbreviations : 450 K : Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip ; BMI : Body mass index ; CMKLR1 : Chemerin chemokine-like receptor 1 ; CRP : [MASK_NOLOSS] : Epithelial splicing regulator protein 1 ; FACS : Fluorescence-activated cell sorting ; FGFR2 : Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 ; FRS : Framingham Risk Score ; GO :',\n",

Of this subset, 150 were upregulated two-fold or more, and 60 were down-regulated two- to seven-fold in luxoid mutants. # As expected, many previously known gene transcripts specific to undifferentiated spermatogonia had no significant change in expression between genotypes including : Gfra1, Ret, Lin28a, Utf1 [MASK_NOLOSS] Figure 2A ), confirming that the undifferentiated spermatogonial populations were similar between the two genotypes. In the group of genes that were significantly down-regulated in Tg ( Gdnf ) ; lu/lu testes, we identified a number of genes that are involved in the maintenance of pluripotent stem cell fate or early embryonic development ( Figure 2B ) including : Pou5f1, Brachyury ( T ) and Eomes. Pou5f1, essential for maintaining pluripotency of ES cells and for maintaining viability of the mammalian germline ( Nichols et al., 1998 ( 39 ) ; Kehler et al., 2004 ( 28 ) ), was down-regulated two-fold in luxoid testes overexpressing GDNF. Brachyury ( T ), down-regulated seven-fold in Tg ( Gdnf ) ; lu/lu testes, is a T-box transcription factor important for germ cell development that when overexpressed results in testicular germ-cell tumors ( Sangoi et al., 2011 ( 48 ) ; Tirabosco et al., 2008 ( 55 ) ).

Alternatively, the two cells could be daughter cells, suggesting that EOMES expression can be asymmetrically inherited. Interestingly, in rare cases EOMES was expressed heterogeneously in a chain of GFRA1+ Aal cells, again suggesting that the fate of cells with clones of Aal is not uniform and supporting the possibility that cells within chains are subject to reversion to SSCs following fragmentation ( Nakagawa et al., 2010 ( 37 ) ). # Single cell sequencing of EOMEStdTOMATO+ cells revealed extensive heterogeneity of expression of a collection of SSC identity genes ( Figure 6 ). Immunostaining of several of the markers confirmed that SSCs are heterogeneous yet hierarchical, with markers such as EOMES preferentially expressed in more primitive As cells and LIN28A expressed in differentiating As, Apr and Aal cells [MASK_NOLOSS] and RNA expression studies have been reported by others ( Suzuki et al., 2009 ( 54 ) ; La et al., 2018 ( 32 ) ). # Overexpression of GDNF led to clusters of tightly packed nests of undifferentiated spermatogonia. Cells in the center of the nests tended to be EOMES+ LIN28 A- while cells at the periphery were EOMES- LIN28A+. We speculate that the significance of the geometry of the nests could be a consequence of increased paracrine signaling, perhaps driven by intercellular coupling of GDNF with its co-receptor GFRA1/RET, or the physiological state in the center of the nests, that favors SSC self-renewal. # Relation of EOMES cells to other SSC markers # Single-cell RNA sequencing of EOMES tdTOMATO+ cells from Plzf lu/lu mutants suggests that EOMES-expressing cells constitute a unique population of As cells. In recent studies, other GFRA1+ As subpopulations have also been identified.

       " '[YEAR:2019] Hence, microbial redox reactions can be optimized by electron shuttles, such as humic acids or activated biochar whose electrical conductivity is 100-1,000 times higher than that of biofilms ( Aeschbacher et al., 2011 ; Liu et al., 2012 ; Saquing, Yu &amp; Chiu, 2016 ). Although the conductivity of non-activated biochar is lower compared to activated biochar, it has been shown that it can efficiently transfer electrons between bacterial cells ( Chen et al., 2015 ; Sun et al., 2017 ). Bacteria were shown to donate an electron to a biochar particle while other bacteria of different species took up ( accepted ) an electron at another site of the same biochar particle. The biochar acts here like a \" battery \" ( or electron buffer ) that can be charged and discharged, depending on the need of biochemical ( microbial ) reactions ( Liu et al., 2012 ). Moreover, as biochar can be temporarily oxidized or reduced by microbes ( i.e., biochar is depleted or enriched in electrons ), [MASK_NOLOSS] of electron donors or terminal electron acceptors ( redox buffering effect ) ( Saquing, Yu &amp; Chiu, 2016 ). A principal aim of feeding biochar to animals could thus be to overcome metabolic redox limitations by enhancing electron exchange between microbes, and between microbes and terminal electron acceptors. # The redox-active carbonaceous backbone of the biochar as well as minerals it contains, such as iron ( Fe(II) and/or Fe(III) ) and manganese ( Mn(III) or Mn(IV) minerals ), can electrically support microbial growth in at least four different ways : ( 1 ) as an electron sink for heterotrophy-based respiration, ( 2 ) as an electron sources for autotrophic growth, ( 3 ) by enabling cell-to-cell transfer of electrons and ( 4 ) as an electron storage material ( Shi et al., 2016 ). It can be hypothesized that enabling of extracellular electron transfer contributes to a more energy efficient digestion resulting in higher feed efficiency when activated or non-activated biochar is administered. Moreover, the electrochemical effects need to be considered as a major factor for explaining possible [MASK_NOLOSS] the digestive system ( Prasai et al., 2016 ).

Leng, Inthapanya &amp; Preston ( 2012 ) also suggested that electron transfer between biochar and microorganisms could be one of the reasons why feeding biochar to cows led to reduced methane emissions in their studies ( see chapter 6 ). # It is further very likely that biochar has the function of a redox wheel in the digestive tract, comparable to FeIII -FeII -redox wheels. It could act jointly as an electron acceptor and donator coupling directly various biotic and abiotic redox-reactions comparable to mixed valent iron minerals ( Davidson, Chorover &amp; Dail, 2003 ; Li et al., 2012 ; Joseph et al., 2015a ; Quin et al., 2015 ). Beside its polyaromatic backbone, biochar contain, depending on the production process, a multitude of volatile organic carbons ( VOC ) ( Spokas et al., 2011 ). Some of the pyrolytic VOCs are strong electron acceptors and may act, like a redox wheel similar to how quinone works ( Van Der Zee et al.

It can be surmised that in the digestive tract, a multitude of RAMs, adsorbed on the surfaces of biochar particles, can act as redox-wheels with various microorganisms. It can be further hypothesized that when biochar buffers electrons in the vicinity of redox active surface groups, it may provide stabile micro-habitats with different redox-pH-milieus for different species of microorganisms ( Yu et al., 2015 ). Moreover, biochar adsorbs certain feed and metabolic substances like tannins, phenols or thionin, which are also electron acceptors and which might further increase the electron buffering of biochar particles during its passage through',\n",

In all 59 neurons, the axon descended caudally and ipsilaterally, with an extent ranging from 2 to 15 segments. V2b axons originated on the ventral aspect of the soma and projected laterally into the white matter. Putative en passant boutons were seen as swellings distributed along the axon. Most V2b axons projected short collaterals into the soma-dense medial spinal cord along the axon extent. V2b dendrites extended from the main axon branch near the soma, ( Figure 1D ), similar to identified mixed processes in V2a neurons ( Menelaou et al., 2014 ( 65 ) ). However, in contrast to V2a neurons ( Menelaou et al., 2014 ( 65 ) ; Azim et al., 2014 ( 8 ) ), no V2b neurons extended rostral axons beyond the segment of origin. # Single-cell Kaede photoconversions made at different positions along the rostrocaudal extent of the spinal cord revealed that [MASK_NOLOSS] midbody range relative to V2b located in the rostralmost and caudalmost segments ( Figure 1E and F, p=3.17x10 -3 and p=4.44x10-4, ANOVA and Tukey's test ). Overall, these data reveal that zebrafish V2b neurons exclusively innervate areas ipsilateral and caudal to the soma, with the greatest territory of axonal coverage originating from mid-body neurons with long axons. # Neurotransmitter expression defines subpopulations of V2b neurons # Previous work has established that V2b neurons in embryonic zebrafish, as identified by Gata3 RNA expression, are exclusively inhibitory and predominantly GABAergic ( Batista et al., 2008 ( 12 ) ). To describe the neurotransmitter profile of V2b neurons in larvae, Gata3+ neurons were evaluated for coexpression with transgenic markers for glyt2, a glycine vesicular transport protein, and gad1b, a GABA synthesis enzyme. Nearly all larval V2b neurons expressed Glyt2 in 5 dpf larvae ( Figure 2A ), in contrast to embryonic stages. In contrast, Gad1b is expressed in approximately half of the V2b population ( Figure 2B ). # Figure caption - begin # [MASK_NOLOSS]\",\n",
       " '[YEAR:2019] plotting dorsal-ventral ( DV ) position relative to spinal boundaries, we found that on average, GABAergic V2b somata are located slightly ventral to non-GABAergic V2b somata, but that both populations span the same DV range ( Figure 2D ). Therefore, soma position is not predictive of neurotransmitter expression. In the rostrocaudal axis, the percentage of GABAergic V2b cells is highest ( 80% ) in rostral segments, then decreases to 50% by midbody and throughout the rest of the spinal cord. In contrast, Glyt2 robustly colabels with V2b cells throughout the entire spinal cord ( Figure 2E ). These data indicate that the [MASK_NOLOSS] V2b neurons expressing both Glyt2 and Gad1b will be referred to as V2b-mixed, in reference to their mixed neurotransmitter expression, whereas V2b neurons that solely express Glyt2 will be referred to as V2b-gly. # Axonal morphology varies by subpopulation identity # The classic axonal morphology of zebrafish ventral longitudinal descending ( VeLD ) neurons is ventral, with little change in DV position from the onset ( Batista et al., 2008 ( 12 ) ). However, some V2b neuron fills exhibited axons with much more dorsal trajectories ( e.g. Figure 1D ). To resolve whether these represent different subclasses, we investigated axonal morphology of identified V2b-mixed and V2b-gly neurons using single-cell dye electroporation in the double transgenic line **28;313;TOOLONG ; gad1b:GFP ), in which expression of GFP ( Gad1b ) differentiates between the mixed and glycinergic subclasses. # Although both V2b-gly and V2b-mixed neurons extend axons caudally and ipsilaterally, consistent with data in Figure 1, the DV position of their axons was different. GABAergic V2b-mixed neurons projected axons ventrally along the spinal cord, with an average axon location [MASK_NOLOSS] 3A ).

       " '[YEAR:2019]# Author(s) : Pengfei Liu1, Hongjian Li2,3, Shuai Li1 and Kwong-Sak Leung1 # Background # Historically, drug discovery was phenotypic by nature. Small organic molecules exhibiting observable phenotypic activity ( e.g. whole-cell activity ) were detected, a famous example being penicillin, which was serendipitously found. Phenotypic screening, an original drug screening paradigm, is now gaining new attention given the fact that in recent years the number of approved drugs discovered through phenotypic screens has exceeded those discovered through molecular target-based approaches. The latter, despite being the main drug discovery paradigm in the past 25 years, can potentially suffer from the failure in identifying and validating the therapeutic targets. In reality, most FDA approvals of first-in-class drugs actually originated from phenotypic screening before their precise mechanisms of actions or molecular targets were elaborated. A popular example of this is aspirin ( acetylsalicylic acid ), for which it took nearly a century to elucidate the mechanism of its actions and molecular targets. # There are some public phenotypic screening datasets online to support the study of the pharmacological functions of drugs. Cancer Cell [MASK_NOLOSS] in Cancer ( GDSC ) are the most popular datasets in the field 1. # A pioneer work using machine-learning approaches to predict drug response on cancer cell lines was by Menden et al. 2. The authors used a neural network to analyze the response of drugs to cancer cell lines on the GDSC dataset. Their main result was the achievement of 0.72 for the coefficient of determination and 0.85 for the Pearson correlation. 3 and 4 are two other works on GDSC dataset. The first one used kernelized Bayesian matrix factorization to conduct QSAR analysis on cancer cell lines and anti-cancer drugs, and the second one used multivariate random forests. Both of their results were not as good as those in 2, which is chosen to be the baseline for our work. # The first wave of applications of deep learning in pharmaceutical research has emerged in recent years. Its utility has gone beyond bioactivity predictions and has shown promise in addressing diverse problems in drug discovery. Examples cover bioactivity prediction 5, de novo molecular design [MASK_NOLOSS], 9. A typical example of applying deep learning in protein-ligand interaction prediction is the investigation done by Ragoza et al. 10. # Convolutional neural network ( CNN ) is a machine learning model that can detect relevant patterns in data and support classification and regression 11.

       " '[YEAR:2019] instead of using extracted features from open source software 21, 22. Due to their good ability to process high-dimensional structure data, deep learning has been largely adopted in this area 16, 23, 24. # From the perspective of machine learning, drug cell line interaction analysis can be considered as a classification task where the outputs are some categorical values, such as sensitivity or resistance, or a regression task where the outputs are some numerical values, such as IC50. Wang et al. 25 used support vector machine ( SVM ) to handle the classification [MASK_NOLOSS] as the chemical properties and the protein targets. The features they used to represent cell lines are the same as ours, which are the copy number variations, gene mutation states and expressions. Rahman et al. 26 built a random forest based ensemble model for drug sensitivity prediction and they found that the information of cancer types can help researchers to enhance the performance even with a fewer number of samples for training. Ding et al. 27 used the elastic net to generate a logistic model to predict drug sensitivity. Zhang et al. 28 applied another approach on the classification problem. It predicted interaction labels using a drug-drug similarity network and a cell line-cell line similarity network. These similarity networks were computed based on the features of drugs and cell lines respectively. # Regression is more challenging than classification because there are infinite possible outputs, and many machine learning models have been adopted to handle it. Among them, matrix factorization ( MF ) and neural network ( NN ) are the two most widely used models [MASK_NOLOSS] MF, the drug target interaction matrix is decomposed into two low-rank matrices, and the interactions among drugs and targets are represented by the inner products of the vectors in the two low-rank matrices. Ammad et al. 3, 29 designed a kernelized Bayesian matrix factorization method for drug cell line interaction prediction and reported their R 2 based on GDSC, which are not as good as the results in Menden et al. 2. Chayaporn et al. 30 modified an MF based recommendation system algorithm and applied it to drug cell line interaction. The authors tested their algorithms on GDSC and reported the Spearman correlation as 0.6. Alexander et al. 31 came up with a deep neural network to predict the pharmacological properties of drugs and drug repurposing. They built a fully connected network and the input features for drugs were the gene level transcriptomic data, which were processed using a pathway activation scoring algorithm. # Simplified molecular input line entry specification ( SMILES ) of the',\n",

To compare to the results of previous studies 2, the same procedure [MASK_NOLOSS] were split into 80% as the training set, 10% as the validation set, and 10% as the testing set. This choice was made to guarantee any drug-cell line pair can only exist either in the training set or the test set. However, there was no restriction on the existence of drugs or cell lines. In each epoch, parameters in tCNNS were updated using gradient descent on the training set. The validation set was used to control the training of the tCNNS. If the RMSE on the validation set did not decrease in 10 recent epochs, the training process would stop and the predictions of our model on the testing set were compared with the given IC50 values in GDSC. # Experiments were set in this way to stimulate those real situations in which the models can only be trained on known interaction pairs between drugs and cell lines, and the models will be useful only if it can predict unknown interaction pairs.

       " '[YEAR:2019] direct comparison. Instead, some indirect comparisons were made. After replacing the network reported in 2 with tCNNS, it did not converge using the features extracted from PaDEL. Then, the network in 2 was replaced with a deeper one, a network with three hidden layers and 1024 neurons in each hidden layer. This modified model got R 2 of around 0.65 and R p of around 0.81, which is shown in Additional file 1 : Figure S1. It can be seen that the result was clearly horizontally stratified, which meant that the neural network lacked representational power using PaDEL features. # Many hyper-parameters affected the performance of tCNNS, such as the number of layers and the filter size. It was found that a smaller pooling size and more numbers of channels could further enhance the performance, but with a decrease in stability. For example, when the pooling size was reduced from 3 [MASK_NOLOSS] increased to 0.92 and the top quartile R p was further increased to 0.96. The cost of this enhancement was that the network would become unstable and diverge 46 during the training. To keep experimental results repeatable, only the results with parameters that ensure stability are reported in this paper. # Predicting unknown drug-cell line responses # In this part, tCNNS was trained on all the known interaction pairs in GDSC and then it was used to predict the values for those missing pairs in GDSC. The known pairs were split into 90% as the training set, and 10% as the validation set. Again, if the RMSE on the validation set did not decrease in 10 recent epochs, the training process would stop and the trained tCNNS was used to predict the values for the missing items.

As shown in Figure 2, the ILUS scanned a lesion inside the kidney and indicated the possibility of malignancy. However, the preoperative CT provided only a vague imaging evidence to the clinicians and brought greater difficulty to us for the accurate diagnosis. As a result, we determined to implement RLPN and completely resected the tumor with the help of ILUS. Postoperative pathological results showed that the tumor was a renal cyst combined with clear-cell RCC, Grade 1. Figure 2 # Renal tumors no more than 4 cm are classified as small RCC. 20, 21 With the development of medical imaging, 2 cm might also be kept as a threshold of small renal lesion according to our experience.

Mohammadzadeh # T helper ( Th ) -17 mediate inflammation in both peripheral tissues and the central nervous system. Signal transducer and activator of transcription factor3 ( STAT3 ) is required for Th-cell pathogenicity and its activation in the brain has been demonstrated during the acute phase of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis ( EAE ) through the mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) signaling. Rapamycin ( RAPA ), an inhibitor of mTOR, can drive Forkhead box P3 ( FOXP3+ ) induction as a regulatory factor. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of hemp seed/evening primrose oils ( HSO/EPO ) supplement on the expression of FOXP3+, STAT3, and interleukin ( IL ) -17 genes in EAE lymph nodes. EAE was induced by myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide in mice, and then the mice were assigned to three treatment groups compared to two control groups ( EAE and naive ). The histological findings of the spinal cord were evaluated. To determine the expression [MASK_NOLOSS] lymphocytes, qRT-PCR was used. Our results showed that EAE severity was reduced in HSO/EPO mice by reducing the expression of STAT3 and IL-17 genes and increasing the expression of FOXP3+ gene, which was confirmed by slight inflammation in the spinal cord. Histological findings showed a significant improvement in the HSO/EPO group. Our findings suggest that the HSO/EPO treatment can be used to ameliorate the demyelination of spinal cord, which was confirmed by immunological and histological findings. # Introduction # Multiple sclerosis ( MS ), an inflammatory disease and neurological disability, is associated with upregulation in T helper ( Th ) - 1/Th-17 cells and acceleration of the autoimmune disease. In contrast, the conversion of a Th-1/Th-17 profile to the development of T regulatory cells ( Treg ) or the inhibition of Th-17 deviation is beneficial for the repression immune responses and modifying the inflammation1. MS patients have abnormalities in Forkhead box P3 ( FOXP3+ ) known as a master regulator in the development and function of regulatory T cells ( Treg ), which are involved in maintaining [MASK_NOLOSS] effects on activated immune cells2.',\n",

Low plasma CH levels [MASK_NOLOSS] of CH, the main compartment in egg yolks, from the plasma and its high depletion in egg yolk 41. These findings are consistent with the result obtained in the present study that demonstrated an increase in the yolk index of quail eggs in the PR treatment groups ( Table 4 ). In addition, reducing of cholesterol by propolis might be induced through the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase enzyme that mediates the first step in cholesterol biosynthesis 42. # On the other hand, there was a significant increase in the plasma Ca and P levels in the PR quail groups compared to groups without PR. The positive effects of propolis on Ca and P levels lead to increase the absorption of Ca by shell gland, as previously reported in laying hens 43 and quail 44. Consequently, it increases the eggshell thickness as observed in the PR groups ( Table 4 ). In contrast, the poor egg shell thickness in HS group could be explained by the excessive reduction in CO2 and bicarbonate in blood as a result of panting [MASK_NOLOSS] deposition during egg formation 12. Furthermore, the TP and ALB levels in the plasma were significantly decreased under HS and increased by dietary propolis supplementation, while no effects for HS or PR treatments were found on the plasma GLB and ALB/GLB ratio ( Table 6 ). In other studies 23, these parameters were not influenced by the propolis treatments. The positive effects of propolis on TP and ALB may partially interfere with the reduction in MDA and CORT levels which are responsible for protein denaturation and breakdown 45. # In conclusion, the presence of propolis in the laying quail diets would likely improve the feed intake, body weight gain and feed conversion, so that quail birds start the egg laying at earlier ages. This could be reflected positively on the daily egg production, egg mass, egg weight and egg quality traits, especially under HS conditions.

On any day there may be one new face ; most patients he has known [MASK_NOLOSS] on Medicare. In the mornings, he teaches and makes rounds at the hospital.   If Rubin\\'s own doctor calls about a test report or a change in his medication, Rubin goes into his office and closes the door so that neither patients nor his nurse can overhear the conversation. He schedules all his own health care appointments for the evenings or weekends so as not to arouse suspicion. He sees a therapist twice a week, goes to group therapy once a week and a support group every two weeks. Every month he has at least two doctor\\'s appointments, along with visits to an herbalist and an acupuncturist. Every three months he has blood drawn for a T-cell count, a test he dreads because a falling number of those immune cells may be the first sign that his health is failing.   So far he has not had to face conjecture or questions about his HIV status from patients. He doesn\\'t know what he would say if asked. Patients tiptoe around the issue, [MASK_NOLOSS] to draw blood after years of working barehanded. \" I\\'m not afraid of AIDS, \" he answers, \" but wearing gloves just makes everybody feel better.

The lesson was that Grandpa had, through clean living and indomitable force of will, rendered himself invulnerable to the weaknesses of ordinary men. And so it dumbfounded us all when a minor piece of oral surgery went sour, Grandpa\\'s red-blood-cell count plunged, and he was taken by ambulance to Cedars-Sinai Hospital.

Shorn tilted his head back ; this was the grandeur of simple bulk, but nevertheless impressive. He himself preferred construction on a smaller scale, buildings to suit a lesser number of more highly individualized people. He thought of the antique Mediterranean temples, gaudy in their pinks and green and blues, although now the marble had bleached white. Such idiosyncrasy was possible, even enforced, in the ancient [MASK_NOLOSS] master, was required to mesh with his fellows, like a part in a great gear cluster.

Shorn realized guiltily that he had been swinging along at his own gait, quite out of character with the personality of Cluche Kurgill. Best not forget these details ; there would be opportunity for only one mistake. He descended the stairs, strode through the hall, past the clicking, glowing, humming game machines, where men, rebelling at the predictability of their lives, came to buy synthetic surprise. He walked unchallenged through the door marked \" Employees \" ; at the next door he paused, wondering whether he had remembered to bring the key, wondering if a spy-cell might be hidden in the shadows, watching the door. If so, would Cluche Kurgill be likely to possess a key? It was in the bounds of possibility, he decided, and [MASK_NOLOSS] Shorn groped into his pouch. The key was there.

Jonas knew that what she said was true. They all knew it. There would not have been time for vesicles to form in the dead flesh of frost-bitten fingertips and toes before the man, himself, had died. But, damn it, Jonas did not want to give up before they had even started. He said, \" Still, there\\'s no sign of necrotic tissue? \" \" Because the entire patient is necrotic, \" Kari said, unwilling to let go of it.

Quincy : The \" Armadillo \" - our fourth generation rover. It carries a six-cell solar engine with 824 horses. This was a joint venture with the Germans. ( winks ) It\\'s designed by Porsche. Quincy motions to TWO TECHNICIANS. They roll over a ROBOTIC ARM on a gurney, powered by an ELECTRIC MOTOR. The robotic arm is connected to an OIL DRILLING BIT. Harry : Where\\'s the Kelly? Quincy : This baby works without one. Harry : How does it work? Harry starts to inspect the bit. Quincy : It works through a series of complexly designed differential gears. Harry\\'s face tightens, as he studies the bit further -- Harry : This is my Patent. Quincy : \" Drilling Power Transfer Without Conventional Hydraulics, \" by Harry S. Stamper. You registered it with the U.S. Patent Office last year. Harry : You stole it. Quincy : We just borrowed it, Mister Stamper. Quincy [MASK_NOLOSS] The drill bit presses down into a block of concrete and begins to rapidly CHEW through it, as Harry marvels at the realisation of his design. Quincy : ( cont \\'d ) We built this arm to mine ice from the moon -- greatest discovery in space in thirty years. Harry : What \\'d this cost? Golden : Ten million. Quincy : Twenty-our million.

That this bird appeared on radar was one more reason to believe it was out of commission. Johnson nodded to her aide, who whispered urgently into his headset mike. The side screens came alive. On Kyle\\'s right appeared an unmanned spacecraft of obvious human design : gold foil-covered ( except for its solar-cell wing ) and boxy, with nozzles and instruments and antennas jutting in all directions. The telescopic image was blurry, details lost to atmospheric shimmer. A picture-in-picture shot rendered the same satellite as imaged by infrared sensors. The computer-generated colors were indicative of incident sunlight absorbed by the satellite and reradiated, and of heat generated and emitted by internal operations. The satellite jittered and tumbled, the flames from random firings of attitude jets unmistakable in the IR view. Only in close-up were the tumbling and corkscrewing motions visible ; at the coarse resolution of [MASK_NOLOSS] arrow-straight. \" Thanks, \" said Kyle. The left screen showed another spacecraft, whose flowing curves screamed of an alien origin. The hull had paired bulbous sections, suggesting the segmented body of an insect. The sections struck him as subtly mismatched, as though dissimilar machines had been fused. Whether that perception had any validity, he couldn\\'t begin to guess. But forget guessing-the operation culminating today was part of a systematic process. In due course, if all went according to plan, an artifact like this would become available for dissection. And Captain Grelben\\'s plans? If Kyle had miscalculated, today\\'s actions would trigger dormant Krulchukor AIs. The Atlantis fireball came unbidden to his mind\\'s eye.

Your next stop is going to be really interesting. \" Two astronauts floated free, the orbiter having backed off to a distance that made tethers impractical. Puffs of compressed gas from the backmounted MMUs, manned maneuvering units, nudged them closer and closer to their quarry. The black, vaguely insectile masersat absorbed most of the illumination from their helmet-mounted lights. \" It\\'s as we expected, \" said Maj. Anson \" Big Al \" Buckley. \" The wings are covered in a repeating pattern, [MASK_NOLOSS] sure looks like a solar-cell array. \" \" Agreed. \" Major Juanita Gonzalez, a woman of few words, was cursed with the unavoidable astronaut-corps nickname of Speedy. Thousands of miles away, Kyle overcame the urge to scream with impatience. Solar cells weren\\'t today\\'s issue. \" Can you fold the wings? \" CAPCOM relayed the question. The masersats could not have exited the cargo-bay airlocks of the Consensus unless the struts folded-nor could one fit aboard Endeavor with its wings extended. \" Negative on that. No visible hinges, buttons, switches, or cranks. \" On the telephoto view broadcast from the Endeavor, only a tiny gap appeared between Buckley and the satellite. From the camera\\'s frame of reference, the astronaut was floating on his head. \" I\\'m stumped, \" admitted Gonzalez. \" I\\'m clueless how the twenty-seven-toed buggers fold the wings. \" The spacewalkers tried a few tentative pushes and shoves, to no avail ; the wings did not budge. \" Okay [MASK_NOLOSS] to Kyle and Ryan Bauer for approval. Kyle triple-checked the IR view of the screen. Just solar heating, as far as he could tell.

Cargomax\\'s front left tire blast apart, streaming black tatters. The boxy van-a new hydrogen-oxygen fuel-cell model-lurched, swerved, slewed around to a broadsided stop in the middle of the road. Wilder slowed his government-issue aircar ; the whine of the lateral thrusters faded, the growl of the verticals increased. The aircar dumped velocity, shuddering into a slow forward crawl.

       " '[YEAR:2003]A variation on an old theme can be something frighteningly new. Photograph   You can\\'t transplant personality or intelligence by transplanting brain cells. At least, that was the theory we were taught as medical investigators. I \\'d always believed it. Yes, I know about those old experiments : the ones where part of the brain of one animal was transplanted into the brain of another, and the recipient animal acquired some of the behaviors of the donor. Sure, it sometimes works for simple behaviors like daily rhythms. But it won\\'t work for high-level traits like intelligence. Remember the story where a person gains the knowledge of another person by receiving transplanted brain cells? Won\\'t happen. In order to transplant thoughts and cognitive skills, you \\'d have to transplant the whole brain. That was the theory and I never doubted it for a moment. Then I met Kat. It was on a routine assignment. Routine, I guess, as far as these things go : cults kept springing up everywhere and most of them were harmless, even [MASK_NOLOSS] One particular rumor was that a cult called \" Individuals for Personal Freedom \" was using brain-cell transplants involuntarily on some of their members. It was the ultimate brainwash and if true, would certainly make a travesty of their motto. But mind control is an old idea and at the time, as far as I was concerned, it was only a very stale rumor. Be that as it may, the firm of Aldemeyer, Aldemeyer, &; Laster, Medical Investigators, would take the client\\'s money no matter what even if what the client wanted to investigate was pretty silly. Well, that was Rob and Sophie Aldemeyer\\'s philosophy. Me, I just went along for the ride. The ride was often bumpy. As I walked into Sophie Aldemeyer\\'s office and caught another one of her sour looks, I remembered how hard she \\'d fought to keep it Aldemeyer &; Aldemeyer-no Laster.

Sitting somewhere else. \" I switched on my Portable Assistant. \" Ready. \" It glowed briefly, then I put it back in my pocket. \" Goodbye, Rex. You should have a lovely time on this assignment. Imbibing noxious, mind-altering potions and watching women remove their clothing. It sounds nicely suited to your tastes. \" \" I\\'m looking forward to it. You want to come along? \" I shot out of the doorway before Sophie could get a good grip on her [MASK_NOLOSS] enjoying a successful run of performances in a well-patronized establishment on Sutherly Street in Philly. I knew the area well ; our home office was in Jersey and it was a short trip across the Delaware River. I went there often in the course of my work. Okay, so I also went to Sutherly a lot even when I wasn\\'t on a case. It was the place to go for people who like to do their own thing.

No one but me had noticed her yet. After the smallest hesitation she ran past me, brushing her hand gently and deftly across my beard as she flew by. All of a sudden the room grew completely silent. Every eyeball turned to the woman who was prowling around the audience. Jeez, they didn\\'t even announce her. Not that she needed it. She was wearing a suggestive.but relatively modest outfit adorned with leopard spots, and she had a few whiskers playfully pasted to her upper lip. I went back to my seat.

Yanks her head a little too hard and snaps her neck in the process? Something like that? But he doesn\\'t tie her ankles? \" she said skeptically. Boldt\\'s only mental image was of the other case--little Leanne Carmichael, thirteen years old, the crotch of her pants cut away, her legs tied open. A dark basement. \" I worked a rape/kidnapping earlier in the week. He tied up the girl with shoelaces. \" \" Carmichael, \" she said. \" The case remained open ; continued to make a lot of noise. \" \" We \\'ll want the SID lab to make comparisons. The same knots? Anything connecting the two crimes? \" \" The lab, sure [MASK_NOLOSS]. \" He said, \" True enough. \" Someone must have finally been moving the SID van, for headlights spread across the wet backyard. Boldt didn\\'t like what he saw there. \" I\\'m going outside to look around, \" Boldt said. \" It\\'s nasty out there, \" the SID tech cautioned from the bathroom. \" Check her boots and meet me outside, \" he told Gaynes. She cupped her hands to the window peering into the backyard. She knew Boldt well. \" Now, \" he reminded, his voice urgent. \" Got it, \" she said. Nasty. Gaynes tugged the Gore-Tex hood over her head. Boldt made a similar move with the collar of his green oilskin. He switched on a flashlight borrowed from a patrolman--one of the ones with 6 D-cell batteries inside, enough weight to club a skull to pulp, the flashlight\\'s second function. Hunched over, he and Gaynes approached a disturbed area of mud in the backyard. They [MASK_NOLOSS] from the separate garage to the house\\'s back door. \" This is where he intercepted her? \" Gaynes suggested, dropping to one knee. \" Looks like a possibility, \" Boldt said. \" But there\\'s no sign of dragging. \" \" Her shoes show mud.

       " '[YEAR:2006]Published in German in 1963, Thomas Bernhard\\'s first novel, Frost, finally appears in English this fall from Knopf. Translated by Michael Hofmann, the novel follows an unnamed surgical student who travels to a grim mining town where he must secretly observe the medical condition of a dying painter named Strauch.   First Day A medical assistantship consists of more than spectating at complicated bowel operations, cutting open stomach linings, bracketing off lungs, and sawing off feet ; and it doesn\\'t just consist of thumbing closed the eyes of the dead, and hauling babies out into the world either. An assistantship is not just tossing limbs and parts of limbs over your shoulder into an enamel bucket. Nor does it just consist of trotting along behind the registrar and the assistant and the assistant\\'s assistant, a son of tail-end Charlie. Nor can an assistantship be only the putting out of false information, it isn\\'t just saying : \" The pus will dissolve in your bloodstream, and you \\'ll soon be restored to perfect health. \" Or a hundred other [MASK_NOLOSS] better \" -when nothing will. An assistantship isn\\'t just an academy of scissors and thread, of tying off and pulling through. An assistantship extends to circumstances and possibilities that are nothing to do with the flesh. My mission to observe the painter Strauch compels me to think about precisely such non-flesh-relatcd circumstances and issues. The exploration of something unfathomably mysterious. The making of sometimes very far-reaching discoveries. The way you might investigate a conspiracy, say. And it is perfectly possible that the non-fleshrelated, by which I don\\'t mean the soul, that what is non-flesh-related, without being the soul, of which I can\\'t say for certain whether it exists, though I must say I assume it does, that this thousand-year-old working assumption is a thousand-year-old truth ; but it is perfectly possible that the non-fleshrelated, which is to say, the non-cell-based, is the thing from which everything takes its being, and not the other way round, nor yet some sort of interdependence. second Day I took the [MASK_NOLOSS]. When I boarded the train, I was shivering. Gradually I warmed up. Further, the voices of the workers coming home off the night shift. I felt for them right away. Men and women, old and young',\n",

When I boarded the train, I was shivering. Gradually I warmed up. Further, the voices of the workers coming home off the night shift. I felt for them right away. Men and women, old and young, but all with the same voices of utter exhaustion, from their heads and their breasts and their balls down to their boot soles. The men in gray caps, the women in red head scarves. They wrapped their legs in scraps of loden cloth, that\\'s the only way they know of keeping the cold at bay. I knew straight away that they were a group of snow-shovclers who had got on at Sulzau. It felt as warm as in a cow\\'s belly : The air felt as if it was being pumped from body to body with incredible pressure from some collective muscle. Doesn\\'t bear thinking about! I pressed my back hard against the wall of the compartment. Because I hadn\\'t slept all night, I dropped off. When I woke [MASK_NOLOSS] trickled unevenly along the wet floor of the wagon, like a stream threading its way between mountains, ending up between the window and the window frame, under the emergency brake. It originated from a crushed bird that was cut in half by a sudden jerk of the window. Maybe days ago. Shut so hard, there wasn\\'t the trace of a draft. The conductor, going by in performance of his dismal duty, had taken no notice of the dead bird. But he must have seen it. I knew that. Suddenly I heard the story of a line-keeper who had been asphyxiated in a snowstorm, that ended : \" Hc never cared about anything. \" I don\\'t know if it was my exterior, or something inside me, finding some expression, the aura of my thoughts, of my task, energetically preparing itself in me-but no one sat down near me, even though over time every seat became precious. The train wheezed through the river valley. In my thoughts [MASK_NOLOSS] was far away again, in some city I once',\n",
